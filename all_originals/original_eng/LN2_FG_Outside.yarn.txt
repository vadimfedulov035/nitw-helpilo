Adina: Hey you! #line:82d8ac
Snowthief: Hey YOU! #line:04508c
Adina: So, who are you? #line:039d6f
Snowthief: I was an exceptional thief. #line:0c0f52
Adina: How did you end up in the forest? #line:d7e121
Snowthief: I was going to rob the Huncher. #line:5d3315
Snowthief: She's been there forever. #line:966a85
Snowthief: She's got to have loads of priceless crap. #line:6ef121
Adina: How did that go? #line:bd1295
Snowthief: I remember reaching up, trying to grab the sun #line:1a5b3c
Snowthief: as the snow covered me. #line:cb3862
Snowthief: You do dumb half-asleep things when you die. #line:b5be5d
Adina: Huh. #line:fb18eb
Snowthief: There's your deep insight on the dying process. #line:fcaa28
Adina: Appreciate it. #line:f6c7a1

GodtenderBrown: Hm. #line:5578ce
Adina: Sorry, is that a weird question? #line:de5f62
GodtenderBrown: No, not at all. #line:464696
GodtenderBrown: I think it gives me a truth I can't find anywhere else. #line:ad6e46
GodtenderBrown: And one I have to find every day when I wake up. #line:08335b
GodtenderBrown: Like, it's there, but I don't have a map to it. #line:db1289
GodtenderBrown: and looking for it is where I find everything else. #line:8e9949
Adina: Wait, but isn't the Forest God in there right now? #line:099fca
Adina: Where is the mystery in what you're looking for? #line:ef38f0
GodtenderBrown: The Forest God does not behave as I always expect #line:5395d0
GodtenderBrown: and the difference between my expectations and reality #line:cfa8c9
GodtenderBrown: is mystery enough. #line:205048
Adina: Fair enough. Thank you. #line:a331c4
GodtenderBrown: You are quite welcome. #line:f791da
GodtenderBrown: I can only hope that the Forest God may heal. #line:5386a5
