Adina: Hey! #line:048ad5
Snowacle: Hey, you! Still alive, eh? #line:dcb81a
Snowacle: I just saw all of the trees give a great shudder #line:86baa0
Snowacle: like they were falling into line #line:ac7600
Snowacle: and then you walked up. #line:8496f0
Adina: I think the way is open to the Frozen Lake! #line:be9e7d
Adina: What do you think about that? #line:3b97c7
Snowacle: I think you should wrap up any business you have #line:7e5619
Snowacle: and head east as quickly as possible! #line:b53483
Adina: Hm. What business would I still have? #line:fcde20

Adina: I'm looking for the Huncher? #line:e7a128
Snowacle: I never found her. #line:0d031c
Snowacle: and maybe that's a good thing. #line:4e5205
Snowacle: she is not the forest god. she does not grant passage. #line:cb91bf
Snowacle: she is something altogether more... nihilist? Is that the word? #line:d3b1d9
Adina: Huh. #line:b09190
Snowacle: She's an impulse playing itself out. #line:20fdaa
Snowacle: She isn't the first, and she won't be the last. #line:1dd8a0
Adina: What? #line:a13d06
Snowacle: Oh I don't know, child. I'm just talking. #line:f6146e
Snowacle: You'll never find her hollow without something to help you #line:678132
Snowacle: and I never found out what it was. #line:ee92d4
Adina: thanks anyway. #line:c90923
Snowacle: be careful. you're getting into something here. #line:8a0b4b

Adina: I'm a bit nervous about the frozen lake. #line:f84f90
Snowacle: Do you know the story? #line:3d0044
Adina: Not really. #line:68be83
Snowacle: Of how the lake was so deep #line:87e7af
Snowacle: it went down to the grave #line:ec4d77
Snowacle: and the dead came to the surface #line:0e21ec
Snowacle: and spoke with the living? #line:9579f3
Snowacle: Of how it was so black #line:54f41c
Snowacle: that it ate the moon's reflection? #line:a4067c
Snowacle: And how the moon, being jealous, #line:d3cf57
Snowacle: convinced the sun to turn its back on the lake #line:43bf01
Snowacle: so it would be forever frozen? #line:532c65
Snowacle: That is why the dead may be found beneath the ice. #line:ab121d
Snowacle: For they can no longer leave those waters. #line:8f813c
Adina: Did any of that happen? #line:ca4bfa
Snowacle: You're the one going there. #line:506c81
