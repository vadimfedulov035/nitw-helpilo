AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}and i joined a skeptic society on the internet #line:b8ae4f
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}and that kinda ruined me on a lot of other supernatural bullshit. #line:5971d0
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}and it gave me something to solve #line:0e3f6a
AngusAsPope:{locator=popebubble}something you could debunk or know... #line:c99f6a
