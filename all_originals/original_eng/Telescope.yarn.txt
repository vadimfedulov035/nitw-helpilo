Chazokov: Ah yes. Castys. #line:f7c9b5
    ->What's Castys? #line:9422ac
    ->Totally it is. #line:e4244b
        Chazokov: You know this one already? #line:63a943
        Mae: Nope. #line:28b7f7
Chazokov: This star tells the story of a woman who built a tower to heaven. #line:e8bdf0
Chazokov: And for this the gods sunk her deep into the sea. #line:a5d5ab
Mae: Wow. That's screwed up. #line:eb71e2
Chazokov: But even in the depths, she refused to die. #line:e1c648
Mae:[shake=.01]DAMN STRAIGHT.[/shake] #line:08d014
Chazokov: Oh, will you never die as well? #line:3830cb

        Chazokov: Beh heh heh heh! #line:125e56
        Chazokov: Defy Castys' gods also, will you? #line:baf44b
Chazokov: The gods in these stories are only stand-ins #line:fae4ed
Chazokov: for things we cannot control. #line:1aefe0
Chazokov: You might say floods, or the cancer, or such. #line:d5f55f

<<tell Telescope ShowConstellation>>
<<wait 2>>
Chazokov: Ah yes. Dohr The Murderer. #line:7aced8
Mae: Ok I'm interested. #line:b91366
Chazokov: Dohr passed Behrn The King's procession on the street. #line:fc471b
Chazokov: Dohr was quiet and said nothing, and the King took offense to this. #line:344272
    ->Why? #line:735ceb
        Chazokov: Royalty is strange. #line:7ae9cd
    ->Geez. #line:e6c552
Mae: So what happened? #line:ac93c3
Chazokov: Behrn insulted Dohr, Dohr's family, Dohr's village, and so on #line:27f339
Chazokov: until he was down to insulting Dohr's chickens. #line:c4d6a6
    ->Damn. #line:905377
    ->Chickens are kind of awful. #line:cd9168
        Mae: Weird horrible angry dinosaurs. #line:a19dc0
        Mae: They peck each others eyes out! #line:a9ec9a
        Chazokov: They are delicious. #line:00173d
        Mae: They deserve to be delicious. #line:a029ba
Chazokov: Dohr first murdered Behrn's chickens. #line:80c609
Chazokov: then his ancestral village #line:b42663
Chazokov: then his family #line:056f4c
Mae: Holy crap. #line:8fb487
Chazokov: And when he came to Behrn #line:c33a1b
Chazokov: the king was silent. #line:828164
Mae: I'm going to get a tattoo of this guy. #line:15e138
Chazokov: Is Dohr a hero? #line:b04272
    ->Totally. #line:98592b
    ->I dunno #line:74c743
        Mae: but it doesn't really matter I think? #line:f40d5c
Mae: Like if you've been told you're nothing before #line:4fc565
Mae: A story like this sounds pretty ok. #line:272b5a
Chazokov: Well it is a true story and real people died #line:314376
Chazokov: and you should feel terrible. #line:9a2146

Chazokov: Sterling the seer. #line:ee849b
Mae: how come I've never heard of these guys? #line:6ffabc
Chazokov: eh #line:8fb263
Chazokov: by the time they got to these rare stars #line:701fa2
Chazokov: the well known myths and legends were taken. #line:ef6044
Mae: oh. #line:49f7b4
Chazokov: This one, Sterling, is a tale of the world changing #line:f9af8b
Chazokov: and leaving one behind. #line:a96c7c
    ->these are all gonna be bummers, huh? #line:f5ba69
        Chazokov: that is not for me to say. #line:2f95a0
        Chazokov: is it a bad thing for the world to move on? #line:cdafd7
        Mae: Well i mean this guy probably doesn't think so. #line:c0a7bc
    ->was he not psychic? #line:24f162
        Chazokov: who can say? #line:7ec040
        Chazokov: do we believe any tale occurred? #line:407f7c
        Mae: hm. #line:434acc
Chazokov: either way, one day his king met a new sage- #line:3fda4f
Chazokov: an astronomer. #line:29776f
Chazokov: and she showed the king how the planets and stars #line:9f34d9
Chazokov: orbit in regular patterns, and why. #line:4c10e7
Chazokov: and the king kicked Sterling out of his quarters #line:192de7
Chazokov: for the seer had long told the king #line:19e606
Chazokov: a different story about the stars. #line:66a9d2
    ->did Sterling believe his own story? #line:e855b8
        Chazokov: i believe he did. #line:a87ed7
        Mae: well that's how things go. #line:fa53e9
    ->that sounds fair. #line:6058b2
Chazokov: is there no responsibility #line:c0797c
Chazokov: to care for those whose labors #line:f6c04a
Chazokov: even one's universe #line:ec2372
Chazokov: are suddenly replaced with a new one? #line:24cc6e
Chazokov: are they obsolete? #line:206642
    ->that's how life is! #line:e04255
        Chazokov: so you believe #line:18602a
        Chazokov: that some should go hungry #line:a6f6f5
        Chazokov: and without homes #line:b14c10
        Chazokov: because they are no longer useful #line:58145d
        Chazokov: to those in power? #line:94c3a6
        Mae: well geez mr. chazokov when you put it that way #line:d2ec8c
    ->no. #line:b487bd
        Chazokov: what is to be done? #line:a77050
        Mae: i don't know. #line:eaa7b1
        Mae: uh #line:9f8c72
        Mae: isn't there some other job the king could give him? #line:15c6fa
        Mae: or some way #line:ca025a
        Mae: where he doesn't have to be useful to the king #line:df515f
        Mae: in order to survive? #line:c1c577

<<tell Telescope ShowConstellation>>
<<wait 2>>
Chazokov: Ah yes! Simone the fighter! #line:c4ad15
Mae: she got a gun #line:43c6c9
Chazokov: Simone lived in a good land #line:d49e94
Chazokov: but under every good land are the roots of oppression #line:0950ea
Chazokov: and in this land those roots took hold #line:a75caa
Chazokov: and choked out all else. #line:0fc6f0
    ->that was poetic, Mr. Chazokov #line:46e16c
        Chazokov: thanks. I was just reading the summary off my phone. #line:39360f
        Mae: oh #line:b2ac31
        Chazokov: we may not have signal, but we have wifi! #line:0996f7
    ->geez. #line:4fa3ca
        Chazokov: it happens faster than one can imagine #line:0024f3
Chazokov: Anyway, when the borders closed and the curfew began #line:0f2f5e
Chazokov: Simone and her comrades began to plot. #line:ed6d82
Chazokov: they infiltrated, they sabotaged, they freed prisoners. #line:0c1fff
Mae: very nice. #line:666015
Chazokov: Simone was one of the first to be identified #line:998886
Chazokov: but she evaded capture even as the wanted posters went up. #line:91febb
Chazokov: As whispers of her grew throughout the land #line:e7c5f2
Chazokov: more and more of her neighbors prayed in the night #line:94b3c9
Chazokov: that Simone would be their salvation. #line:cc484c
    ->was she? #line:a4a096
    ->that's a lot of pressure for one person. #line:2e8636
        Chazokov: She was not alone, of course. #line:7a5993
        Chazokov: she was but one part in a growing organism #line:50e2d7
        Chazokov: but she became a symbol. #line:1e535e
        Chazokov: it is difficult to think of many things #line:810752
        Chazokov: so sometimes having a symbol for all of them #line:e6b960
        Chazokov: is important. #line:770135
        Mae: like numbers. #line:1a7af5
Chazokov: We do not know where Simone is buried. #line:21a9cd
Mae: ah goddammit. i knew this wasn't going to be happy. #line:15772b
Chazokov: we do know that when things boiled over #line:e99031
Chazokov: she led a charge against the palace gates #line:bda050
Chazokov: and behind those gates were cannons. #line:1b953f
Mae: oh no. #line:70c0f4
Chazokov: many years later when the mass graves were exhumed #line:43c195
Chazokov: her bones were mixed with so many others #line:9da60a
Chazokov: it was said that she now lives on #line:09ef66
Chazokov: in the bones of all in her country. #line:484d6d
Mae: geez. that got dark. and sad. and spooky. #line:4de239
Chazokov: Beh heh heh. #line:8348c2

Chazokov: how so? #line:fb88c0
    ->that's just called being alive #line:5b8062

Chazokov: it is. #line:d64f82

Chazokov: Kol was from a flat land. #line:3921ea
Mae: this midwest? #line:16aa83

Mae: every place has a midwest. #line:e5eab5
Chazokov: this is true. #line:591762
Chazokov: he dreamed of mountains #line:9e595c
Chazokov: and devoted his life to climbing them. #line:e6e72e
Mae: ...because his hometown was flat? #line:4f919d
Chazokov: isn't this a common instinct? #line:428e69
Chazokov: to seek that which is unlike where one grows up? #line:3c338c
    ->yeah #line:fa3c72
        Mae: i mean people go to the city a lot. #line:16cd7b
