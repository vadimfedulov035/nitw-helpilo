Mae: Wait. What the- Who are you? #line:469e66
HeadMiner: Buncha of old boys doing their damnedest #line:1d8e54
HeadMiner: to protect their own and their neighbors. #line:cbad07

Miner2: Kill you?! #line:66b9b6
Miner1: Nobody's gonna kill you! #line:ea1422
HeadMiner: All of you are part of this town. #line:a7807c
HeadMiner: by family relation or just by being hard workers. #line:05eb39
Miner2: Contributors! #line:af7ee4
Mae: Um. ok. #line:fc789e
Mae: so we could just leave? #line:ef10ce
HeadMiner: Well, *he* brought you down here for a reason #line:fd42eb
HeadMiner: and he’s not gonna let you leave until he’s had his say. #line:3efbae
Mae: Well *he’s* already got an arrow through the shoulder. #line:e25179
Mae: I don’t think he’s gonna be having much say in whatever. #line:055250
HeadMiner: … #line:9e82ce
Miner1: ... #line:f23b32
HeadMiner: Wait. So you think that Eide- #line:7ca5ae

Mae: i’ve seen this #line:e664cc
Mae: or I’ve… I’ve felt it… #line:2318c1
HeadMiner: Was Ed Skudder and Jim Dorney who found it. #line:5edb59
HeadMiner: 20 years back or so. #line:4fa2d8
HeadMiner: After the west mine closed out past Briddle #line:2ba925
HeadMiner: Vest Schumacher. Last supervisor. #line:4069f7
HeadMiner: was out there when the company locked off the entrance #line:934427
HeadMiner: carved his initials and date in the door. #line:3afdc1
HeadMiner: Then you got this mine, the Old One. #line:799adc
HeadMiner: not even a proper mine. Big hole. Copper. #line:1fe3b5
HeadMiner: Abandoned, shoot, long before any of us were born. #line:9acaca
HeadMiner: too close to water. #line:cef1b3
HeadMiner: And that water was poison #line:4c5e7d
HeadMiner: when the first settlers came out here. #line:68797c
HeadMiner: that old spring used to be right above where we’re standin’. #line:7459e3
HeadMiner: but that water dried up. #line:2249e6
HeadMiner: 1992 or so some men from west mine #line:d8db32
HeadMiner: come back up here to try bootleggin, #line:5bc533
HeadMiner: practically built a new elevator, got the main tunnel cleared #line:6d7c49
HeadMiner: never found no coal, just dug deeper n' deeper #line:72d500
HeadMiner: til Ed busts through that wall and finds this place #line:a2e2b9
HeadMiner: and Jim walks right into that hole #line:b6c465
HeadMiner: and never hits bottom. #line:a825cc
HeadMiner: Ed calls down to Jim #line:54971f
HeadMiner: Jim don’t answer #line:c7a65e
HeadMiner: but someone else does. #line:3cf62f
HeadMiner: I know you heard that voice, girl. #line:7537b6
HeadMiner: In dreams and in waking times. #line:832e35
HeadMiner: ‘swhat brought you down here.  #line:2c55bd
	-> what... what is it? #line:72418c
		HeadMiner: black goat #line:b32c2b
		HeadMiner: not even black like the color #line:38f3ac
		HeadMiner: black like the space between the stars #line:a804ee
		HeadMiner: he’s down there, in that hole #line:c11bb0
		HeadMiner: looking up at us right now #line:e2d277
		HeadMiner: he don’t talk to ya #line:50a38b
		HeadMiner: he... sings... #line:acd5c5
		Mae: why would you just do something a hole in a cave told you to? #line:c367a8
	-> so what does this have to do with you, or me, or anyone? #line:d85a8c
HeadMiner: you got to understand #line:bcd8f4
HeadMiner: in those days it was the end of the world #line:abb786
HeadMiner: jobs gone. Our kids were leaving. #line:a753b7
HeadMiner: government didn’t care, only wanted our votes. #line:8bb773
HeadMiner: just puttin in more regulations, sendin our jobs overseas, #line:7e9f18
HeadMiner: spendin our taxes on lazy people 'n immigrants #line:577068
HeadMiner: while we worked ourselves to death. #line:adb3fa
Bea: ugh here we go. #line:3e9d63
Bea: goddamn i hate this crap. #line:8163f4
Bea: you old dipshits. #line:624bf1
HeadMiner: you finished? #line:f7fec1
<<wait 2>>
Bea: yeah sure. #line:d27195
HeadMiner: we prayed and prayed up at the church, #line:978d46
HeadMiner: but when Ed Skudder came back down here and listened #line:d9dfdb
HeadMiner: he got answers back. #line:baf109
	-> oh god… i think i know... #line:9f2c7b
		HeadMiner: yeah he’s already in there singin to ya, right? #line:7af2f5
		Mae: I… I… #line:0a4439
	-> answers? #line:2fa067
HeadMiner: Ed explained it to a few folks, and they didn’t believe it #line:87fc7a
HeadMiner: but he was persuasive #line:eeb2f5
HeadMiner: he had the glimmer. #line:cb3240
Mae: "the glimmer?" #line:1015f1
    Miner2: ones 'e takes a shining to #line:0ea804
    Miner2: it rubs off on ya. #line:075950
    Miner2: you can do things. #line:478928
    HeadMiner: I never seen it #line:e79e9f
    HeadMiner: but they said Ed could walk through walls. #line:95fe07
    Mae: ok. #line:a4598f
HeadMiner: after Ed talked us into all this, #line:a75dcb
HeadMiner: after that first time, after we picked one out #line:91876b
HeadMiner: well... #line:d1a65b
HeadMiner: not only was the town holdin' stable #line:2c056c
HeadMiner: but it was almost like we were getting younger, and money came too #line:985d8b
HeadMiner: still a few of us left from back then #line:b0a354
    -> “Picked”? #line:c71d7a
        HeadMiner: first one was Tom Turner, who believe you me was a bastard #line:2b0cf2
        HeadMiner: just pure trash #line:2986b4
        HeadMiner: we got him down here #line:fd26b7
        HeadMiner: and in the hole he went. #line:19f263
        HeadMiner: the next week, flowers bloomin’ all over the hills #line:fe58cc
	-> “First time?” #line:fb8f01
		HeadMiner: First one into the hole by our own hands. #line:f3d3c1
		HeadMiner: We own up to what we do. I was there. #line:20e244
		Miner2: I was too. #line:3456fb
Bea: You throw them in the hole? #line:9fcff6
Mae: ... #line:40cd46
Mae: they’re... feeding him... #line:d94c50
HeadMiner: he's hungry like you wouldn't believe. #line:7e02a3
HeadMiner: every few months or so he starts singin’ #line:08d873
HeadMiner: and it’s someone’s turn to find someone. #line:917b48
    ->was that what you were doing the other night? #line:67df82
        Miner1: No. #line:24d94b
        HeadMiner: What happened the other night was a shame. #line:d4b4b2
        HeadMiner: One of our number broke the rules. #line:f1a6b3
        HeadMiner: an' had to pay up. #line:9ba194
        HeadMiner: that was a hard thing to do #line:98abb3
    ->... #line:465f51
Mae: i think i’m gonna be sick... #line:845e22
HeadMiner: we never pick noone who’s gonna be missed #line:3715ef
HeadMiner: that’s a solid rule. #line:6fd1c9
HeadMiner: Drifters, drunks, and delinquents. #line:17b5f3
Mae: you’ve been… oh god… oh no... #line:9a43d3
	-> How many people have died down here??? #line:da0628
		HeadMiner: oh, I’d say… #line:265865
		Miner1: 3 dozen. Give or take. #line:a66c29
		Miner2: 39. #line:ff2fbb
		Miner2: am I the only one keeping steady count? #line:293c86
		HeadMiner: I do now. Early on I think we all wanted to forget. #line:f3d38f
        Miner1: i still got a feelin' heart. it still hurts. #line:a39d79
        Miner2: yeah that dirtbag kid from the spring... #line:049375
        Gregg: C...c...casey? #line:516c41
	-> Casey?  #line:d0c486
HeadMiner: The Hartley kid? #line:0d1d82
HeadMiner: all he was gonna contribute to society #line:6e0a16
HeadMiner: 'cept a buncha kids growin up with no dad #line:f05a29
HeadMiner: was a rap sheet a mile long #line:d75e7e
HeadMiner: before whatever sad end he’d wind up at. #line:ef33ad
HeadMiner: we did him a FAVOR. #line:67895a
Gregg: You... k-killed... Casey? :( #line:06bbe2
Angus: oh my god. #line:0e524e
HeadMiner: we don’t use that word. #line:17fb63
HeadMiner: you know he was taking up business with his cousin, right? #line:9b811c
HeadMiner: you know what happened to his cousin? #line:15e282
HeadMiner: burned alive when his little trailer lab exploded #line:29a7e8
HeadMiner: they had to wear hazmat suits when they cleaned him up #line:8b470a
HeadMiner: that’s where Casey was headed. #line:072c20
Gregg: You killed Casey. #line:c3a8d8
HeadMiner: and you want to act like we didn’t do him and this whole town a favor? #line:befca1
Mae: oh god... Casey’s been down here the whole time. #line:2b7be5
Mae: his parents put up posters! #line:62e34d
HeadMiner: maybe they shoulda cared more about him before it came to this. #line:a6aecf
