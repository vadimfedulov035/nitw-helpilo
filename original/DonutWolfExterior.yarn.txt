Gregg:{locator=left,width=1}What kind of dream? #line:6c8671
Mae:{locator=right,width=3}I was standing beside this well in the middle of some field. #line:1d0ac5

Gregg:{locator=left,width=1.5}Mmhmm? #line:9662d0
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}And I kept trying to back away from it #line:685e9b
Mae:{locator=right,width=3}but every time I moved I slipped in the mud and ended up closer to the well. #line:c39bff
Gregg:{locator=left,width=1}Crap. #line:f054d6
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}So I just had to stand still. #line:6cb39d
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}Not move at all. #line:2212d0
Gregg:{locator=left,width=1}That sounds freaky, dude. #line:4c5eb6
Mae:{locator=right,width=1.5}And the worst thing was #line:8afd0f
