CatGod: and I am not this god #line:ec8ecf
CatGod: and this god is nowhere #line:335e0f

Mae: aaagh #line:f27b40
Mae: oh god. oh god. #line:bb6ef4
CatGod: they are blind, but they are seeing you #line:98af44
CatGod: and you are coming to them #line:795b10
CatGod: after this you are not returning here #line:1d6510
CatGod: i am climbing into the air #line:90d58a
CatGod: and closing the sky #line:61f820

CatGod: and there is nothing to remember it #line:d18390
CatGod: not even the things beyond #line:2b8a50
CatGod: and now there is only the hole #line:071802
Mae: so... does anything mean anything? #line:63ec68
CatGod: this is not a question worth answering #line:f0c28d
-> what about my home? What about my friends? #line:d12326
	CatGod: soon they are dying #line:211db5
	CatGod: soon they are rotting #line:83e7b0
-> what about trees in the fall? What about the leaves? #line:77a1a2
	CatGod: bare existence, meaning nothing #line:543324
CatGod: you are atoms #line:6c5437
//begin blurry fade to black//
CatGod: and your atoms are not caring if you are existing #line:3add4e
CatGod: your atoms are monstrous existence #line:fe9968
Mae: then why am I here goddammit? Why was i chosen to see all of this? #line:fce248
Mae: where is this going? #line:99265f
CatGod: little creature, you are not chosen #line:551cbe
CatGod: there is no one to choose you #line:33f5a3
CatGod: this is going nowhere #line:034f0c
CatGod: we are not meeting again #line:a547d5
//fully black now//
CatGod: and the universe is forgetting you #line:02c14c
CatGod: and I am remembering you #line:6decf6
CatGod: but not because I am caring #line:e3194f
CatGod: the beginning is moments ago #line:1b7a0e
CatGod: the end is moments away #line:fefbd3
CatGod: there is no time to forget #line:fb74aa
CatGod: before all is forgotten #line:777671
CatGod: goodbye, little creature #line:e97d11
