    Mae: Clanky’s probably got loads of heat but it can’t get out. #line:b8cfe2
-> ...to turn up the fire. #line:b5bd4b
    Mae: Clanky’s probably got a tiny fire going and could use some help. #line:d95dc0
    Mae: We’ve all been there! Poor Clanky. #line:b81038
Mae: to get Clanky all hot and bothered. #line:d02dcc
