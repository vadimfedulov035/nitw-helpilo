    Bea: These days? Not much. #line:79d750
    Bea: Uh. Some administrative stuff.  #line:eca0c3
    Bea: He hires the repair guys... #line:c587a5
    Bea: He sometimes goes out on jobs. #line:f9a95a
    Bea: That’s kind of his whole area. #line:be6444
    Bea: But that's about it. #line:db91e9
-> Your dad’s kinda up and down, huh? #line:7293f6
    Bea: He has good days and bad days. #line:4fdfdc
    Bea: Often in the same day. #line:9d2966
    Mae: ha ha. Gregg's always been like that too. #line:082417
    Mae: just more... uh... zany about it. #line:5b1456
    Bea: well Gregg is probably bipolar #line:20dafe
    Mae: gee thanks, doctor bea. #line:a4fdea
    Bea: whereas my dad is having a years-long breakdown. #line:9897f7
    Mae: You run the whole store now, right? #line:e475a9
    Bea: More or less. #line:c6918f
Mae: Yeah but it’s still his name on everything. #line:f34c0f
Bea: Yep. #line:82def7
Mae: And meanwhile you’re running basically everything. #line:d3351c
Bea: Yep. #line:1a4f00
Bea: And! And! working there every day too. #line:b4790e
Bea: Yep. #line:c8b856
Mae: I just think you shouldn’t. #line:569b20
Bea: Ok. #line:716f40
    ->I just think you're like selling yourself out. #line:9f5f8b
        Bea: I’m sorry, what? #line:059d5e
    ->I would probably just quit. #line:22fd92
        Mae: or like, take over the store. #line:bec99d
Mae: Like, you not doing anything about it just reinforces- #line:fec487
<<lookNearest Bea>>
<<dilate Bea .85 .01>>
Bea: Is this really the road you want to go down with this? #line:0263b8
    ->I’m saying you should stand up for yourself or just like... quit! #line:f22375
        Bea: "Quit"? #line:1ac3fa
        Bea: Really? Just quit. #line:ea9982
        Bea: You are seriously detached from reality. #line:664f2d
    ->I’m saying it’s not right that you just roll over and take it. #line:20b44f
        Bea: "Take it?" #line:fc8fbe
        //shake text here//
        Bea: "TAKE IT"?!?!?! #line:59958b
Mae: You’re doing all the work and he’s getting all the credit! #line:7ea678
Bea: oh go to hell. #line:8f03d3
Mae: :( #line:54d630
    ->WHAT?! #line:b96f27

Bea: here's some reality for you: #line:626f2f
Bea: You know Creek? Repair Guy Creek at the shop? #line:eded91
Mae: :| #line:a950b4
    -> No? #line:f1e3d5
        Bea: You’ve seen him. #line:253370
        Bea: Talks a lot. Worked for us since forever. #line:bb93e3
    -> ...yeah? #line:237794
        Bea: yeah you met him when we were kids. #line:6688c4
Bea: When I was 15 he asked my dad if he could teach me how to drive. #line:2a3c6a
Bea: And my dad said no, and then told me not to be alone with him. #line:5f675b
    -> What the? #line:a9dba0
        Bea: Yeah. Exactly. #line:7b3182
    -> I don't follow. #line:233c30
        Bea: he's a creep, Mae.  #line:262819
Bea: And you know what? HE still works for us. #line:d6abc7
Mae: :( #line:b8c6e6
Mae: !!! #line:1cc84b
Mae: Why haven’t you fired him?!?! #line:511b54
<<fadeOutAmbientSFX _AmbientSFX:music 10>>
<<playAmbientSFX _AmbientSFX:record_static 10>>
Bea: I can't fire people! #line:9ac5ae
Bea: And even if I could, he’s on the crew. #line:1600a2
Bea: And frankly he’s our best guy. Practically heads up the repair team. #line:3a6007
Bea: Since my dad’s barely doing anything! #line:061703
Bea: And Creek’s got a family. And he needs the work. #line:ba6468
-> That’s disgusting! #line:3248ca
    Mae: \o/ #line:6cfc04
    Mae: It’s not your responsibility to- #line:74a597

    Bea: YEAH! ME TOO! #line:cfa497
    Bea: I’M REALLY FAMILIAR WITH THAT FEELING. #line:cd700c
Mae: :| #line:80b660
Mae: I’m just saying if you keep letting these dudes off the hook- #line:74e4ec
Bea: OFF THE HOOK?! #line:3cf05c

    -> What the hell? #line:d9538d
       Bea: "uuughhuhuhg what the hell?!" #line:587e5e
Bea: A lot of time folks can’t just "choose" to do #line:b8580b
Bea: whatever it is you decree to be the right thing! #line:9c0f4a
Bea: A lot of times people do the things they do #line:9ca6dc

        Bea: and no consequences for your stupid actions #line:09fdea
    -> You can ALWAYS choose. #line:c22a4c
        Bea: choose what? #line:b67b8f
        Bea: honestly. tell me. #line:b08dd9
