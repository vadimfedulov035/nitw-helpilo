Angus: Wow. Looks like some of the whirly note things came back. #line:e59ecb
Mae: the what? #line:199677
Angus: uh we made these little windmill things #line:85ae37
Angus: and each put an anonymous note in them #line:6be2d7
Angus: attached to this little spring-controlled helicopter #line:7f45d7
Angus: and the idea was that when the wind would pick up #line:c40262
Angus: the windmill would wind up the helicopter #line:43e5b4
Angus: and the note would fly away. #line:ee9230
Angus: looks like some of them blew back. #line:5e65e3
Mae: that's... an amazing coincidence. #line:432c1d
Angus: oh no that was the idea. #line:3839b2
Angus: each year we'd read notes left from the year before. #line:4ba912
Mae: i'm gonna see if i can find any more! #line:0848bf
Angus: i'm gonna hike up here. been a while. #line:e9af98
