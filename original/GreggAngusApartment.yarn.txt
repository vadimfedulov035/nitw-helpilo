    Bea: no.  #line:db5b1b
    Bea: we weren’t talking then and I thought it’d be weird to bring it up now, and... #line:a79d29
    Mae: I was playing this video game. You were like dating ghosts or something. #line:6b1b71
    Bea: ok #line:17a58b
    Mae: and I was really into it. Played it like 24-7. #line:406492
    Mae: until this one afternoon #line:77b876
    Mae: and suddenly, like, something broke. #line:012eac
    Bea: broke? #line:f95007
    Mae: it was just like... pixels. #line:03d8d3
    Mae: the characters onscreen… i felt like i knew them #line:334b44
    Mae: they weren't /people/ anymore. They were just shapes. #line:c7a858
    Mae: and their lines were just things someone had written #line:8053ce
    Mae: they never existed, they never had feelings #line:0cec39
    Mae: they never would exist, either #line:18a0fe
    Mae: and it felt so /sad/ #line:ec135b
    Mae: like i’d just lost these real people #line:1934b9
    Mae: and this whole thing we had, it was just... me. Alone. #line:685853
    Mae: and like that realization like dumped out of the screen and into real life #line:6b98bb
    Mae: went outside and the tree out front, #line:41a20a
    Mae: I looked at it every day, it was like a friend outside the window #line:003b76
    Mae: now it was just a thing... just a thing that was there #line:941c9f
    Mae: growing and eating and just /being/ there #line:e9728a
    Mae: like all the stuff i felt about the tree #line:a25282
    Mae: was just in my head #line:9e9efa
    Mae: and there was some guy walking by #line:7eaf72
    Mae: and he was just shapes #line:278823
    Mae: just like this moving bulk of... stuff #line:1b8138
    Mae: and I cried #line:420373
    Mae: because nothing was there for me anymore #line:d718f2
    Mae: it was all just stuff. Stuff in the universe #line:73f1de
    Mae: just... dead #line:5f9857
    Bea: wow... that's... huh #line:35e549
    Mae: And the next day was that softball game #line:f5915d
    Mae: and Andy was the pitcher when I was up #line:ecc63d
    Mae: and he was just shapes too #line:4ef3fb
    Mae: just lines someone wrote #line:0b251e
    Mae: like nothing in there #line:9e0969
    Mae: and I was so scared and angry and just... I dunno #line:791cd0
    Mae: before I knew it I was on top of him #line:e69168
    Mae: smashing his face in with the bat #line:97a9dc
    Mae: just shapes #line:220b02
    Mae: red shapes all over the grass #line:a0dbc1
    Bea: oh my god, mae. #line:1db181
    Bea: have you talked to anyone about this? #line:5ad820
    Mae: after it happened they made me go to therapy #line:2d1b75
    Mae: with Dr. Hank- #line:0c3d62
    Bea: oh gaaaaaaaawd. He’s the worst. #line:f65d14
    Mae: and he made me start a journal #line:45fdac
    Bea: a journal? #line:bde14b
    Mae: yeah he kinda just said it would help to be able to get my thoughts down #line:dc949b
    Bea: did it help? #line:9823ed
    Mae: kinda? sorta? #line:5056d3
    Mae: but since this whole thing happened, when I'm alone in a new place #line:6d03b6
    Mae: it's all shapes, like back at the softball game #line:586596
    Mae: I was doing fine at college for a while #line:eedce4
    Mae: but I couldn't make friends, I was just afraid of being outside or around people alone. #line:f1e890
    Mae: And there was this statue of like the founder of something. #line:054aa7
    Mae: a really shitty statue, like all rusty metal, #line:cc7c76
    Mae: and it was these shapes #line:98f619
    Mae: and he was pointing down at me #line:18dc6f
    Mae: and I was so... scared... I didn't leave my dorm room, #line:5c373d
    Mae: I either didn't eat or I ate entire pizzas at once #line:bf2b38
    Mae: I downed cough syrup just to sleep all the time #line:223714
    Mae: and finally I got up the courage to leave. #line:8fe6f5
    Mae: and I came home. Where everything was fine. #line:d3b2ec
    Mae: where I knew everyone, and it wasn't just... dead shapes. #line:91c30f
    Mae: watching me. #line:8ac271
    Bea: Geez. #line:2025fb
    Mae: something broke. In my head. In my life. #line:c9ad03
    Bea: i don’t mean to be like… whatever, but #line:e0ee3d
    Bea: it sounds like you’re suffering from some serious stuff #line:7b2b4f
    Bea: and like, I can help you find some help for it? #line:ef3b82
    Mae: Dr. Hank already tried! #line:850753
    Bea: I think Dr. Hank should stick to family medicine and dentistry #line:a9f82d
    Bea: and the half dozen other things he does #line:de3073
    Bea: and maybe leave the mental health services to someone else. #line:f340de
    Bea: like there are such things as depression and anxiety and like #line:cbc108
    Bea: i dunno… what you’re going through, it exists. #line:477a62
    Mae: I… I thought when I came home… #line:718385
    Mae: i just- #line:727210
    Mae: i felt so safe here #line:312b0e
