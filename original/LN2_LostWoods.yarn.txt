HuncherKidLW: She just left. #line:93a80c
Adina: Just now? #line:86660d
HuncherKidLW: All I know is that sometime after she left #line:fb873e
HuncherKidLW: something happened. #line:763e06
HuncherKidLW: She stopped being what she was. #line:02349c
HuncherKidLW: I don't know if she died, or... #line:9975a1
HuncherKidLW: but something is happening to me. #line:175797
Adina: Can't you just go back home? #line:606e4d
HuncherKidLW: Child, I am home. #line:15a1ce
Adina: Oh. #line:8a1c9d
HuncherKidLW: But I am going to visit where I came from. #line:83a2a4
Adina: That's good! #line:2d3fbe
HuncherKidLW: No. No, you don't understand. #line:635220
HuncherKidLW: I used to hope no one who knew I was gone would come looking for me. #line:fe7557
HuncherKidLW: But now I'm going to go looking for them. #line:0f7170
HuncherKidLW: The townsfolk will weep when they see what I've done to them. #line:8f4fb8
HuncherKidLW: And as they go into the ground, I will dig them up #line:e6d646
HuncherKidLW: I will place them in the beds of those who loved them. #line:c218f5
HuncherKidLW: And people will look at that ruin of a town #line:a12a4a
HuncherKidLW: and say it is haunted. #line:d49560
Adina: Oh, Kid, listen to me- #line:992b3d
HuncherKidLW: Oh please, child. #line:de7388
HuncherKidLW: Until an hour ago I was younger than you. But now I am far, far older. #line:8987ec
HuncherKidLW: You were kind to me, and I will give you this kindness in return: #line:ea4b96
HuncherKidLW: We won't meet again. #line:22bcdd

Snowacle: and maybe that's a good thing. #line:4e5205
Snowacle: she is not the forest god. she does not grant passage. #line:cb91bf

Adina: Huh. #line:b09190
Snowacle: She's an impulse playing itself out. #line:20fdaa
Snowacle: She isn't the first, and she won't be the last. #line:1dd8a0
Adina: What? #line:a13d06
Snowacle: Oh I don't know, child. I'm just talking. #line:f6146e
Snowacle: You'll never find her hollow without something to help you #line:678132
Snowacle: and I never found out what it was. #line:ee92d4

Snowacle: Do you know the story? #line:3d0044
Adina: Not really. #line:68be83
Snowacle: Of how the lake was so deep #line:87e7af
Snowacle: it went down to the grave #line:ec4d77
Snowacle: and the dead came to the surface #line:0e21ec
Snowacle: and spoke with the living? #line:9579f3
Snowacle: Of how it was so black #line:54f41c
Snowacle: that it ate the moon's reflection? #line:a4067c
Snowacle: And how the moon, being jealous, #line:d3cf57
Snowacle: convinced the sun to turn its back on the lake #line:43bf01
Snowacle: so it would be forever frozen? #line:532c65
Snowacle: That is why the dead may be found beneath the ice. #line:ab121d
Snowacle: For they can no longer leave those waters. #line:8f813c
