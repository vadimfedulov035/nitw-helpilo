Bea: You know what that was about, right? #line:71e812
Mae: Wasn't Cathy pregnant with... what was his name... football guy... #line:8fe6f7
Bea: Ron Boonstra. I didn't know you knew about that. #line:8ef90d
Mae: Well I mean there was the first football game of our senior year #line:2de60b
Mae: and Ron ran up to the sideline and yelled at the stands #line:16ae6d
Mae: "MY FIRST TOUCHDOWN'S FOR MY BEAUTIFUL FIRSTBORN AND HIS MOMMY, CATHY DAMINCO" #line:1cbae4
Bea: That's... something. #line:8f2c0a
Mae: Cathy was in marching band and she was crying I think. #line:09f0f5
Mae: And then he dumped her for Cindy a week later. #line:6dbcc1
Bea: Oh yeah, see that's the part I know about. #line:44cb79
Bea: That's what set off the whole nosering situation. #line:5aca4a
    -> I wonder what Cathy's up to now? #line:abcfc9
        Bea: Well, last year Ron had this ATV accident #line:c585ff
        Bea: and somehow Cathy and him got to talking after that #line:b8ffe1
        Bea: and... they got married! #line:cef3e9
        Mae: Huh. :\ #line:3c4672
        Bea: Yeah Ron's parents set them up out in a double wide out in Briddle #line:e93140
        Bea: since Cathy refused to end up in Possum Springs. #line:b165e1
        Mae: Briddle's like... 15 minutes away. #line:ca5711
    -> I wonder what Ron's doing? #line:09a6c3
        Bea: Uh, last year he flipped his ATV #line:14e300
        Bea: and the medical bills were really high #line:e3d728
        Bea: so his parents basically had to bail him out. #line:08d01f
        Mae: Yeah that'll happen. :\ #line:2ed9e0
        Bea: And he got talking to Cathy again and now they're married. #line:a8bcde
        Bea: Worked out for Ron I guess. #line:58bc90
    ->I wonder what happened to Cindy? #line:a1a9e0
        Bea: I imagine she got a new nosering. #line:bac673
        Bea: Or, conversely, never wanted a nosering ever again. #line:f23eaf

    Bea: But like. I dunno. #line:0d4c42
