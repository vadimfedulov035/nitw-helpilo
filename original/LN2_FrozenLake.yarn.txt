Adina: Hey cat. Figured I'd see you here. #line:df5945
TreeCat: You figured right. #line:62c2a6
Adina: You figured wrong. #line:1276fb
TreeCat: How's that? #line:62cb99
Adina: I didn't die in there. #line:9955cf
TreeCat: So you didn't. #line:fabc52
TreeCat: But then again, I've never died in there either. #line:d4cda4
TreeCat: So pardon me if I'm not overly impressed you did it once. #line:8e9f06
Adina: You are such an ass. #line:b963df
TreeCat: You certainly caused a lot of trouble tonight. #line:efd792
Adina: I didn't mean to. Just passing through. #line:9b7b82
TreeCat: Isn't that always the way. #line:e2de1f

Astronomer: You know, I doubted you would make it. #line:822279
Adina: A promise is a promise. #line:c77fd2
Astronomer: How is home? #line:674ff6
Adina: Same as ever. Colder now of course. #line:bab937
Adina: The sheep shut down the 5th street bridge again on Longest Night eve. #line:3352eb
Astronomer: Ha ha ha! #line:4db8e8
Adina: The farmers were there all day trying to pull them off. #line:8902d1
Astronomer: Have they figured out why they keep doing that? #line:91423f
Adina: No one has a clue. #line:da15d1
Astronomer: Hm. #line:b207f4
Adina: I know you can't stay long. #line:1402bc
Astronomer: I can't. So ask. #line:cafb9a
Adina: Ok, did you find the ghost star? #line:12c4a5

Adina: Yes. #line:11fa2f
<<close>>
<<wait 2>>
Adina: It's funny. #line:32ff6f
Astronomer: What is? #line:32ce9c
Adina: It's always been there. #line:8d6331
Adina: I just had no way of seeing it. #line:14ae17
Astronomer: You still can't, not really. #line:8ead87
Astronomer: But you can chart where it is. #line:741b68
Astronomer: That's something at least. #line:a8757e
Adina: Wow. #line:0d0fae
Adina: I feel like just a few feet away #line:b9278d
Adina: there's this thing, bigger than I can think about, #line:de33f7
Adina: burning away. Exploding. #line:ae627f
Adina: And between us is this sheet of black. #line:2e9ed6
Adina: And when I think about it I feel like I'm going to overflow. #line:aff355
Astronomer: I think about this a lot these days. #line:f87dcf
Astronomer: We devote ourselves to something we barely understand, #line:f2da82
Astronomer: something we can never touch. #line:14577e
Astronomer: We give it a name, and we give ourselves a name for doing so. #line:c43958
Astronomer: All of it creates this connection. #line:2dfa2e
Astronomer: And that connection, that becomes the thing we can touch. #line:d29526
Astronomer: You appreciate those connections even more after you've died. #line:d487b9
Adina: I'm gonna miss you all over again now. #line:c8f772
Astronomer: Well, on the bright side, you got a star out of it. #line:53a20e
Adina: That's something, at least. #line:4e1705
Astronomer: Ha ha ha. #line:88acd5
Astronomer: Pretty amazing to be something, at least. #line:606f07
Adina: Yeah. #line:4ec8dc
Astronomer: Goodbye, Astronomer. #line:ce5a35
Adina: Goodbye, Astronomer. #line:e7f7ad

Adina: I know. #line:1fea23
TreeCat: Leave all of that here. You were in their forest. #line:5009af
Adina: I'm an astronomer. #line:41bebd
Adina: It may be their forest, but it's under my sky. #line:268991
TreeCat: ha ha ha. i bet that sounded great in your head. #line:a7d6c1

Adina: And this is where I'll find it. #line:df0f65
TreeCat: Are you sure? #line:991388
Adina: At this point I'm so exhausted and cold #line:d26ec8
Adina: that I can't afford to not be sure. #line:1f9836
TreeCat: That's either very sad or very beautiful. #line:11679e

Astronomer: How do you even know who I am? #line:800ce7

Mae: And then Travis told her off... #line:3bb422

Mae: This really annoying kid at school. #line:fe92aa
Granddad: Why would this Travis character exist in the past? #line:98bdc3
Mae: Because he stole a time machine. #line:a0dc9b
Granddad: Right, right. #line:ca5f9b
Mae: Anyways, so then Travis said... #line:a40602
