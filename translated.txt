Mae###we're like way out here, huh?
Angus###in the park? yeah i guess.
Mae###spooky.
Angus###i dunno. it's pretty safe.
Angus###and the stars are pretty.
Mae###So you don’t believe in ghosts at all?
Angus###nah. Don’t believe in ghosts, or gods,
Angus###or psychic powers, or anything like that.
Mae###Not at all?
Angus###I mean there’s no evidence for them,
Angus###and people have really tried.
Mae###Did you ever?
Angus###Yeah, when I was a kid.
Mae###Tell me about it.
AngusAsPope###so... um...
AngusAsPope###i don't know how much i've ever told you
AngusAsPope###or how much gregg has told you
AngusAsPope###but i didn't have the best childhood.
MaeAsBell###yeah i think i heard that.
MaeAsBell###why was it bad?
AngusAsWhale###um... my dad didn't like me.
AngusAsWhale###and my mom didn't either.
AngusAsWhale###and like
AngusAsWhale###um
MaeAsCat###You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
AngusAsWhale###no it's fine.
AngusAsWhale###um my dad
AngusAsWhale###used to hit me a lot
AngusAsWhale###and my mom was probably worse
AngusAsWhale###she like wouldn't feed me
AngusAsWhale###which is why i really like cooking now ha ha
AngusAsPope###she'd like shove me into the pantry
AngusAsPope###and slam the door really hard
AngusAsPope###and all the stuff would fall off the shelves on top of me.
MaeAsBell###oh my god, angus
MaeAsBell###i didn't know at all.
MaeAsBell###That's awful.
AngusAsPope###she'd lock me in there for like a day at a time sometimes
AngusAsPope###or overnight.
AngusAsPope###so I'd like try to develop psychic powers
AngusAsPope###so i could like signal the neighbors
AngusAsPope###or unlatch the door.
AngusAsPope###didn't work, as you might guess.
MaeAsCat###did you ever tell anybody?
AngusAsWhale###i never did.
AngusAsWhale###i don't know why.
AngusAsWhale###after a while I like...
AngusAsWhale###started feeling guilty too for some reason.
AngusAsWhale###like this was something bad i was doing?
MaeAsCat###like... being abused?
MaeAsCat###Angus that's not your fault at all.
MaeAsCat###you were a kid!!!
AngusAsPope###oh don't worry, i know that now.
AngusAsPope###boy do i ever.
MaeAsBell###question: can i go kick all of their asses?
MaeAsBell###like i've got experience. i can eff some shit up.
AngusAsPope###well, my mom is kinda old now.
AngusAsPope###i... ugh... still have to visit her sometimes.
AngusAsPope###i have a brother, he's overseas in the army.
AngusAsPope###and my dad left like 10 years ago.
AngusAsPope###so who knows where he is or if he's even alive.
AngusAsPope###if he is alive i don't want to know about it.
MaeAsBell###Angus I just want to give you a hug forever.
AngusAsWhale###ha ha well
AngusAsWhale###i was luckier than a lot of kids
AngusAsWhale###i'm just glad i didn't like... yeah.
AngusAsWhale###anyway, to your original question-
AngusAsPope###testing out my psychic abilities in the pantry
AngusAsPope###made me really interested in both paranormal stuff and science.
AngusAsPope###and i joined a skeptic society on the internet
AngusAsPope###and that kinda ruined me on a lot of other supernatural bullshit.
AngusAsPope###and it gave me something to solve
AngusAsPope###something you could debunk or know...
AngusAsPope###i dunno. it saved me a little bit i guess.
AngusAsWhale###cuz when someone does all that stuff to you
AngusAsWhale###it can like make you do some bad things to yourself
AngusAsWhale###but anyway yeah. no ghosts or god.
MaeAsBell###So like...
MaeAsBell###I feel like if i'd been through that
MaeAsBell###I'd be *more* likely to want to believe in god or... something
MaeAsBell###do you believe in anything at all?
AngusAsWhale###um well so like the constellations
AngusAsWhale###i don't believe there's a whale out there
AngusAsWhale###but i uh believe that the stars exist
AngusAsWhale###and that people put the whale there
AngusAsPope###like i dunno
AngusAsPope###we're good at drawing lines through the spaces between stars
AngusAsPope###like we're pattern-finders, and we'll find patterns
AngusAsPope###and we like really put our hearts and minds into it
AngusAsPope###and even if we don't mean to.
AngusAsPope###so i believe in a universe that doesn't care
AngusAsPope###and people who do.
MaeAsCat###pattern-finders.
MaeAsCat###i feel like a lot of people don't think they found god
MaeAsCat###but like god found them
MaeAsCat###like, when they were having bad times like you did
AngusAsWhale###god never did
AngusAsWhale###i was completely alone in the pantry
AngusAsWhale###but a few years later
AngusAsWhale###Gregg did.
AngusAsWhale###so like
AngusAsWhale###the stars can stay up there and not give a shit about us
AngusAsWhale###but this whale is pretty cool.
MaeAsBell###you're an extremely good and smart person, Angus.
AngusAsPope###i try.
AngusAsPope###but i'm no more than anyone else.
Mae###It’s a pope
Mae###he breathes fire
Angus###oh this one is real
Angus###or at least the dude is
Mae###Rubello
Mae###there's a statue of him outside church
Angus###Oh, we never went there.
None###did your family go to church?
Angus###weddings and funerals and longest night, basically
Mae###i don't think those first two count.
Mae###those are like *events*
None###do you not know your saints at all?
Angus###nah. none of my family were into it.
Angus###my saints were all like... uh... astronauts and authors.
Mae###That sounds really funny.
Angus###eh.
Mae###my mom works up at the church now.
Mae###I haven't gone really since I was like 14 or 15.
Angus###does she mind?
Mae###she pretends not to.
Mae###ok that’s a bell.
Mae###and in the middle is this eye
Mae###lookin’ at you.
Angus###ok that’s uh...
Angus###I know this one a little from like prog rock album covers
None###i think the world ends when it rings
Mae###that makes sense. it's gonna be really loud.
Angus###there's no sound in space
Angus###i mean like basically no sound. usually.
Mae###that sounds really scary for some reason.
Angus###well at least it means
Angus###we're not gonna get rung to death by a bell.
None###i think you die when it rings when it's looking at you
Angus###well, crap
Angus###it's high up enough it's kinda always looking at all of us, right?
Mae###goddamn.
Angus###Alright. Find me some constellations.
Angus###Wait, are these gonna be real ones or fake ones?
Mae###Just ones I remember
Mae###or dreamed that one time
Mae###ugh
Angus###Whichever.
Mae###Remember Mr. Chazokov?
Angus###Yeah! Science teacher.
Mae###He lives in Underhill and has a telescope on his roof
Mae###and I totally saw some stars through it.
Angus###That’s cool. Telescopes are cool.
Angus###Wish I had a telescope.
Mae###ok let’s see...
Mae###It’s a cat
Mae###he’s got arrows sticking out of him
Mae###and he’s chasing a diamond.
Angus###oh I know this one. don't remember his name.
Angus###he lived uh... you remember the stories about the forest god?
None###yeah!
Mae###my granddad used to tell me adina stories
Angus###oh ok yeah
None###no?
Angus###uh it was like a whole bunch of stories
Angus###there was this person Adina, and-
Mae###oh yeah! Adina and the Frozen Lake!
Angus###yeah that's one of them.
Angus###anyway this cat was in there
Angus###liked shiny things, was good at getting through the forest
Angus###was really good at stealing
Mae###oh wow yeah I used to call him Asscat when i was little
Angus###well then he stole a diamond from a king and got arrowed to death
Angus###but he was slick enough that he jumped out of his body
Angus###and became immortal or something
Mae###huh. decent.
Angus###extremely decent.
Mae###it’s a whale
Mae###and it’s got like the world on its back
Angus###oh wow that's sad
None###yeah
Mae###kind of a lot of responsibility.
Angus###did the whale consent to this???
Mae###i think it just always was that way.
Angus###ooooof.
None###why?
Angus###why does it have to carry the whole world?
Angus###like, that's really unfair!
Mae###ha ha yeah.
Angus###that is legitimately upsetting.
Angus###you gotta wonder why people made these up.
Angus###i mean, like, these specifically.
Angus###who saw a whale and was like "needs to be carrying something"
None###i mean whales are pretty big.
Angus###but what's the whale swimming in?
Mae###Space!
Angus###I guess it's dumb to get mad at ancient people.
None###they didn't know what the earth was.
Angus###yeah but like
Angus###i don't assume everything i don't understand is a whale.
Mae###you could start!
GraveDigger###Hey.
Mae###Sup.
GraveDigger###Been digging some graves.
Mae###Okay?
GraveDigger###Time to wake up!
ManOnHill###we know not when the lord will take us.
ManOnHill###brian knew the dangers of the mines
ManOnHill###but he loved his family.
ManOnHill###and like so many of us
ManOnHill###he put them before his own safety.
ManOnHill###But the god of heaven is the god of the tunnels.
ManOnHill###And we may rest in the knowledge
ManOnHill###That Brian is with Him now.
Crowd###Amen.
ManOnHill###We consign Brian to the dust, and to the care of the Lord.
Mae###Hello?
ManOnFence###What? Who’s there?
Mae###I’m Mae Borowski.
ManOnFence###What do you want, ghost?
Not Stated###Where am I?
Not Stated###Is this a funeral?
ManOnFence###You are in the cemetery in Possum Springs, Pennsylvania.
ManOnFence###But surely you know that
ManOnFence###for you have come here to haunt me
ManOnFence###on such a lonely afternoon.
Mae###I’m not haunting you!
Mae###And I’m not a ghost!
Mae###And it’s night!
ManOnFence###Of Brian Rooke. He is like you now, ghost.
Mae###What happened to him?
ManOnFence###Suffocated down the mines.
ManOnFence###Ed Yacynich tripped over him three weeks later.
ManOnFence###He was buried in coal dust.
Mae###Well that’s pretty horrible!
ManOnFence###They pull him out of the ground
ManOnFence###they cleaned him up
ManOnFence###for awhile they looked at him
ManOnFence###and now they’re burying him again.
Mae###Yeah I guess that’s kind of weird.
ManOnFence###Why do you speak to me, ghost?
Mae###Good god what are we even talking about? :(
ManOnFence###Did Granny send you? To torment me?
Mae###Listen, I'm scared.
Mae###I don't remember how I got here.
Mae###Did I die?
Mae###Did my house burn down with me in it?
Mae###Oh my god... mom and dad...
ManOnFence###why do you torment me?
Mae###PLEASE HELP ME!!!
ManOnFence###sleep in the ground, ghost
ManOnFence###where no one may wake you
ManOnFence###and peace... peace... peace...
Mae###can't read this thing...
Mae###Something something mining company...
Mae###I think this one part says
Mae###population 562?
Mae###huh.
Mae###Hello?
Mae###Can you talk?
CatGod###Yes.
Mae###For some reason, you’re the first thing here I’ve thought to talk to.
Mae###Are you... god?
CatGod###No...
Mae###oh
Mae###So,
CatGod###Seconds ago little creatures are coming
CatGod###and they are asking if I am god
CatGod###and I am asking what god is
CatGod###and they are telling me
CatGod###and I am not this god
CatGod###and this god is nowhere
None###well, you can’t see god
CatGod###you are seeing what you are wishing, little creature
None###well, that’s where faith comes in i guess
CatGod###little creatures are explaining faith
CatGod###and moments ago is the beginning
CatGod###and i am here then and here now
CatGod###and there is nowhere for god to be hiding
Mae###...
Mae###so what am i doing here?
CatGod###monstrous existence
Mae###no, i mean what am I doing *here*?
Mae###what are you? What are those other giant animals?
Mae###have i been seeing ghosts?
Mae###there were like bits of the world...
Mae###i think i was on a train, but it was like a town?
Mae###it’s all-
Mae###ugh. I lost it.
Mae###Ok, so-
CatGod###A great beast is walking through the sands
CatGod###and they are climbing into the air
CatGod###and now they are making a tear
CatGod###and now they are gone
CatGod###and now you are here
None###what?
None###a... tear?
CatGod###With their hooves
CatGod###they are making a tear
CatGod###little creatures are wandering through the air
CatGod###and they are dragging in places and echoes of lives
CatGod###and they are asking me about god
Mae###my head hurts
CatGod###i am going to tell you something, little creature
CatGod###you are swimming further and further out to sea
CatGod###and beyond are things blind and terrible
CatGod###and i am showing you now
Mae###aaagh
Mae###oh god. oh god.
CatGod###they are blind, but they are seeing you
CatGod###and you are coming to them
CatGod###after this you are not returning here
CatGod###i am climbing into the air
CatGod###and closing the sky
None###why?
CatGod###I am tired of speaking with little creatures
CatGod###I am tired of speaking of god
None###closing the sky?
CatGod###yes
Mae###ok...
CatGod###I will tell you a second thing
CatGod###There is a hole at the center of everything
CatGod###and it is always growing
CatGod###between the stars i am seeing it
CatGod###it is coming
CatGod###and you are not escaping
CatGod###and the universe is forgetting you
CatGod###and the universe is being forgotten
CatGod###and there is nothing to remember it
CatGod###not even the things beyond
CatGod###and now there is only the hole
Mae###so... does anything mean anything?
CatGod###this is not a question worth answering
None###what about my home? What about my friends?
CatGod###soon they are dying
CatGod###soon they are rotting
None###what about trees in the fall? What about the leaves?
CatGod###bare existence, meaning nothing
CatGod###you are atoms
CatGod###and your atoms are not caring if you are existing
CatGod###your atoms are monstrous existence
Mae###then why am I here goddammit? Why was i chosen to see all of this?
Mae###where is this going?
CatGod###little creature, you are not chosen
CatGod###there is no one to choose you
CatGod###this is going nowhere
CatGod###we are not meeting again
CatGod###and the universe is forgetting you
CatGod###and I am remembering you
CatGod###but not because I am caring
CatGod###the beginning is moments ago
CatGod###the end is moments away
CatGod###there is no time to forget
CatGod###before all is forgotten
CatGod###goodbye, little creature

Mae###yes.
Mae###no.
Mae###like, the thing in the hole is...
Mae###...geez i lost it.
Gregg###it’s ok.
Mae###it’s like
Mae###a porch light that’s on
Mae###and there are all these bugs around it
Mae###and then the light goes out.
Mae###and there’s a hole where the light was.
Mae###it’s like what happened to me way back.
Mae###like i was telling you about on the couch last night.
Gregg###god, that was last night?
Gregg###seems like 2 weeks ago.
Mae###heh heh yeah.
Mae###it’s going to be weird when you’re gone.
Gregg###well i mean
Gregg###you’ve already been gone.
Gregg###and you’ve been gone at least once since you got back.
Mae###at least.
Mae###i died a little getting that battery the other day.
Gregg###see?
Gregg###you’re a goner.
Mae###like, last night-
Mae###it feels sometimes like there’s so much horrible past
Mae###still trapped in the historical society from the other night
Mae###ha ha just realized i know what that painting was
Gregg###what was it?
Mae###nevermind.
Mae###but it feels like the past can’t just… *LEAVE*.
Mae###and it’s still here
Mae###you’re like swimming in it
Mae###and you can’t have a future.
Gregg###nah brah
Mae###“nah brah”? That’s it?
Gregg###what was our biggest crime ever?
None###almost burning down the school
Mae###that was like our highschool high point
None###bringing a horrible robot son into the world?
Mae###and then leaving him to haunt the woods out by the highway?
Gregg###actually it was probably trapping those dudes in the mine and leaving them to die
Mae###that was self defense!!!!
Gregg###all of that stuff-
Gregg###like, today’s different now because that happened.
Gregg###we’re different.
Mae###yeah
Gregg###so like
Gregg###things change.
Mae###i guess.
Mae###like you said the other day in the woods
Mae###gonna be different because we were here.
Gregg###that’s something.
Mae###something something something
Gregg###what a weird fall it’s been
Mae###yeah. I mean even aside from last night.
Mae###weirdest couple weeks of my life
Mae###like so i was asking about that pentagram sticker?
Mae###yeah so there were these weird teens who told me i was
Mae###uh… nevermind. It’s really stupid saying it out loud.
Gregg###ok
Mae###like i dunno sometimes weird coincidences
Mae###it’s like having the tv on in the room so you don’t feel alone
Mae###or something
Gregg###one of the best things about living with Angus
Gregg###is he’s always there
Mae###angus is your TV
Gregg###and my space heater.
Mae###so those teens told me i’d see a bunch of pentagrams
Mae###you’ll like this- one was on a donut the other night
Gregg###they got the devil in ‘em
Mae###and another was down in the tunnel last night
Gregg###i mean you know what Angus would say
Mae###ha ha yeah
Mae###pattern seeking
Mae###what?
Gregg###he goes off about how people see like patterns they want to see
Gregg###like it’s in our brains. Our brains do that.
Gregg###you know he used to make videos online?
Mae###really?
Gregg###yeah he’d like tell about atheism and also cook
Gregg###“Reason and Cookies”
Mae###holy crap
Gregg###i think i mellowed him out.
Mae###does he still make cookies?
Gregg###yeah and he still yells about atheism too but
Gregg###irl.
Mae###huh.
Mae###there’s this kid i was hanging out with, lori
Gregg###you’ve been hanging out with kids?
Mae###eh. She seems like she needs guidance.
Gregg###that’s nice of you dude
Mae###she like goes to the train tracks
Mae###and squashes these little metal toy dudes
Mae###and they turn into these awesome little messed up monsters
Gregg###i used to do that with pennies
Gregg###wasn’t thinking big enough i guess
Mae###idk. Was thinking about what it’d be like being one of those toys
Mae###like run over by this big massive thing you have no control over
Mae###and it leaves you all deformed and… i dunno...
Gregg###sounds like here
Mae###sounds like here
Gregg###you know my dad really wanted me to go to college
Mae###oh trust me, i remember.
Gregg###oh right. I forgot you were around for that.
Gregg###anyway, he was all
Gregg###“i don’t want you to have to work in a mill”
Mae###ha ha what
Gregg###hey dad. Dude. the factories were half gone when you were my age.
Mae###yeah dad. We work at Snack Falcon now.
Gregg###get with it, dad.
Mae###yeah I got bad news about the fort lucenne mall too
Gregg###oh god dude that’s a deadmall now
Mae###it is extremely dead.
Mae###it’s just a building though. It doesn’t mind.
Mae###you ever been to Germ’s house?
Gregg###nope. Where does he live?
Mae###back up in the woods past the big parking lot
Mae###like last night we were basically in his backyard
Gregg###oh right. Yeah.
Mae###he’s got this spooky grandma
Mae###she like told my fortune. kinda. something like that.
Gregg###you know… germ told my fortune once
Mae###really???
Gregg###yeah we were at the clik clak
Gregg###and he like looked at how i bit a pizza slice
Mae###pizzamancy or some shit
Gregg###it was weird. He got all serious.
Mae###what was your fortune?
Gregg###said i’d die getting hit by a bus
Mae###wow
Gregg###yeah what a downer right
Mae###I thought you were gonna die the other night
Mae###when we were moving that box of parts upstairs
Gregg###you and me both
Gregg###so what did Germ's grandma say?
Mae###i mean if you squint... sorta what happened last night?
Mae###i mean she was also like really rude about my whole
Mae###you know
Mae###brain issues.
Gregg###blech.
Mae###but still, kinda spooky.
Gregg###they’re just kind of a spooky family i guess
Mae###they got a trampoline
Gregg###aw man! Lucky.
Mae###Germ is pretty great. Not gonna lie.
Gregg###i’m a big fan.
Mae###Teens, man.
Gregg###Teens?
Mae###I was just thinking like
Mae###so you know how I asked you about that corpsedriver sticker?
Gregg###yeah
Mae###so these three weird teens told me I’d see a bunch of them
Mae###you’ll like this- one was on a donut the other night
Gregg###infernal hails to donut wolf
Mae###and another was down in that tunnel last night
Gregg###i mean you know what Angus would say
Mae###ha ha yeah
Mae###pattern seeking
Mae###what?
Gregg###he goes off about how people see like patterns they want to see
Gregg###like it’s in our brains. Our brains do that.
Mae###but wait- there was this OTHER teen, Lori
Mae###she’s like 15. we’ve been hanging out
Gregg###so you’re just... hanging out with teens?
Mae###ew no. but lori...
Mae###she needs a good influence
Gregg###that’s nice of you
Mae###so she's like into horror movies and cool shit
Mae###and she squashes these little toy guys on the railroad tracks
Gregg###sounds awesome
Mae###i dunno. Like remember when we were teens
Mae###and we could do crazy shit
Mae###and it was like expected
Gregg###dude since you got home it’s been like crazy shit 24-7
Mae###yeah but like
Mae###that’s shit that *happened* to us
Mae###like seeing the pentagrams
Mae###or if you were one of those toy guys squashed by the train
Mae###or I dunno Bea and I getting trapped in a basement the other night
Gregg###i guess
Mae###is that the difference between being a kid and being an adult?
Gregg###no. not at all.
Mae###yeah i dunno where I was going with that.
Gregg###i think it’s up there for all of us
Mae###like even aside from all the other stuff
Mae###you know how i was asking you about that pentagram sticker?
Gregg###yeah corpsedriver’s really good
Mae###these three weird teens… ok, this sounds stupid…
Gregg###i’m up for some stupid right now
Mae###yeah they said i’d see some pentagrams
Gregg###ok
Mae###you’ll like this- one of them was on a donut the other night
Gregg###ride the chariot to donut hell. It’s right in the motto.
Mae###oh, speaking of wierd stuff, i went to germ's house the other day.
Gregg###oh weird!
Mae###and then his grandma told my fortune. kinda. maybe.
Gregg###you know Germ told my fortune once?
Mae###Whoa really?
Gregg###yeah he told me I was gonna get hit by a bus.
Gregg###like he read it in the bite I’d taken out of a slice of pizza
Mae###did you get hit by a bus and die?
Gregg###not yet!
Gregg###I didn’t get killed when we were moving that box up the stairs the other night either.
Mae###i think that means you’re winning.
Gregg###maybe that’s what winning is.
Mae###whoa
Mae###so this is kind of my point-
Mae###are these just random things and we’ve just been lucky to not die
Mae###or is there like some sort of pattern or
Mae###i mean not god, but like…
Mae###something?
Gregg###i mean you know what Angus would say
Mae###ha ha yeah
Mae###pattern seeking
Mae###what?
Gregg###he goes off about how people see like patterns they want to see
Gregg###like it’s in our brains. Our brains do that.
Mae###you do kinda *want* there to be something making all this happen, right?
Mae###like even if it’s bad, it means there some sort of control
Mae###like someone real smart could figure it out
Gregg###nah. That’s creepy.
Mae###not any creepier than germ and his grandma and those three teens
Gregg###germ’s not creepy. Spooky, maybe.
Mae###yeah. Germ’s the bomb.
Mae###life’s spooky, man.
Gregg###you ain’t lyin
Mae###So I went up to Germ’s house the other day
Gregg###whoa, really?
Gregg###i’ve never been up there.
Mae###yeah it’s back up in the woods
Mae###actually last night we were basically in his backyard
Gregg###oh right
Gregg###what’s his house like?
None###nice. Cozy.
Mae###he’s got younger siblings. didn't meet them though.
Mae###his grandma lives there too.
None###they got a trampoline
Gregg###aaaaaaaaaaw
Mae###i totally jumped on it
Gregg###AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWW!!!!
Gregg###lucky.
Mae###anyway his grandma told my fortune. sorta. kinda. maybe.
Mae###that was weird.
Gregg###Germ told my fortune once.
Mae###really?
Gregg###yeah said I’d get hit by a bus
Gregg###could tell from how I ate a slice of pizza
Mae###was he joking?
Gregg###hard to tell with Germ sometimes.
Gregg###what did his gramma say?
Mae###i mean if you squint... sorta what happened last night?
Mae###i mean she was also like really rude about my whole
Mae###you know
Mae###brain issues.
Gregg###blech.
Mae###but still, kinda spooky.
Gregg###Spooky family.
Mae###i dunno. I guess.
Mae###there’s this teen I’ve been hanging out with, Lori
Gregg###hanging out with teens are you?
Mae###nah. Like, she needs a role model.
Gregg###that's nice of you.
Mae###anyway she lives out by the tracks
Mae###and she like squishes these little metal toy guys
Mae###by putting them on the tracks when a train goes by
Gregg###oh yeah i used to do that with pennies
Gregg###i guess i needed to think bigger
Mae###So like when Germ’s grandma told my fortune
Mae###i couldn’t shake this feeling that it was like something else i’d seen
Mae###and i realized what it was last night when we were down there
Mae###like it all felt like i was getting squashed on the tracks
Mae###and i was getting all deformed and weird and shit
Gregg###huh
Gregg###that’s intense
Mae###like when they did that mountaintop mining south of here
Gregg###ugh.
Mae###i know right
Mae###like things just got all messed up and it looked all squashed down
Mae###i don’t know where I’m going with this
Mae###man, I need like the longest nap you can imagine
Mae###like one that *isn’t* in the hospital.
Gregg###I mean we can go steal another car battery
Mae###ha ha ha ha oh my god
Gregg###put you right out
Mae###sharkle can visit me again
Gregg###what?
Gregg###i can like bonk you over the head with something
Mae###yeah do that
Mae###actually no
Mae###after the other night it might cause actual brain damage
Gregg###how is your head?
Mae###still working.
Mae###oh man if you even knew
Mae###so when we were at Donut Wolf the other night?
Gregg###yeah
Mae###I got that donut with the pentagram on it
Mae###that was part of some shit these three weird teens told me would happen
Mae###like it was gonna help me
Mae###and last night I saw another pentagram down in the tunnel
Gregg###that's why you asked me about that sticker?
Mae###yeah.
Gregg###i mean you know what Angus would say
Mae###ha ha yeah
Mae###pattern seeking
Mae###what?
Gregg###he goes off about how people see like patterns they want to see
Gregg###like it’s in our brains. Our brains do that.
Mae###ok so get this-
Mae###I went to Germ’s house the other day
Gregg###HOLY SHIT
Gregg###i’ve never been there!
Mae###oh it’s nice. Up in the woods. Got a trampoline.
Gregg###aw luckyyyyyyyyyy.
Mae###so his grandma told my fortune. a little. vaguely?
Mae###i could have just been hearing what i wanted to hear or something?
Gregg###Germ told my fortune once. Maybe it’s like a family thing?
None###what did he say?
Gregg###that i’d die
Gregg###getting hit by a bus
Mae###wow. That’s kind of a downer.
Gregg###eh.
None###how’d he do it?
Gregg###he looked at like bite marks in some pizza we were eating
Mae###pizzamancer
Gregg###did you eat pizza with Germ’s gramma or something?
Mae###nah. Just looked at me.
Gregg###so what did she tell you?
Mae###i mean if you squint... sorta what happened last night?
Mae###i mean she was also like really rude about my whole
Mae###you know
Mae###brain issues.
Gregg###blech.
Mae###but still, kinda spooky.
Mae###and like...
Mae###ok so there’s this OTHER person, this girl Lori I’ve been hanging out with?
Gregg###who’s Lori?
Mae###Lori Meyers. She’s like 15, lives out by the tracks
Gregg###you’re… hanging out with teens now?
Mae###eh. She needs a role model.
Gregg###that’s nice of you dude
Mae###we were doing this thing where you put these little metal guys on the tracks
Mae###and the train runs over them and they get all deformed
Gregg###oh yeah i used to do that with pennies
Gregg###guess i wasn’t thinking big enough
Mae###the pentagram thing and germ’s grandma and just all of this
Mae###germ’s grandma and just all of this
Mae###like there’s some sort of thing under this holding it all together
Mae###but not because it cares about us
Mae###the thing in the hole, the ghost dreams or whatever, which i barely remember now
Mae###even like Possum Springs, like we used to have a lot more jobs and people and stuff
Mae###and now we don’t. And none of it’s anyone’s fault really
Mae###anyone here and now at least
Mae###when i was squashing those little toy guys with Lori
Mae###i was like whoa this is us
Mae###i dunno. It’s all like dream logic or whatever
Mae###i feel like there are these giant-
Mae###like when the mills and mine shut down
Mae###but those assholes down in the tunnels thought they could bring it back
Mae###or like nobody goes to the church anymore
Mae###but god’s still gonna come back or something
Mae###or like you leaving the sheep thing open
Gregg###hey!
Mae###like to them the gate’s gone
Mae###and to you the sheep are gone and...
Mae###then like *my* whole bullshit, and...
Mae###...
Mae###ok lost my train of thought
Gregg###man
Gregg###you’re right.
Gregg###you *have* had a weird couple of weeks
Gregg###you need like... something...
Mae###yeah man.
Mae###looking forward to longest night
Mae###something to like reset everything
Gregg###we got in all that Longest Night stuff at work
Gregg###you can just come down there
Mae###earlier and earlier every year
Mae###oh i also gave us a rat infestation in town?
Gregg###what?
Mae###eh. It’s like the one good thing that’s happened.
Mae###Hope springs. Rats Multiply.
Gregg###very poetical.
Mae###i’m extremely poetical.
Gregg###...
Gregg###they killed casey.
Mae###yeah they did. they killed casey.
Gregg###i'm trying not to think about it.
Gregg###do we like... tell his parents?
Mae###what do we tell them?
Gregg###i don't know.
Gregg###is it worse to let them think he's alive
Gregg###or tell them he's in a bottomless hole
Gregg###in a tunnel
Gregg###in the woods
Gregg###with a bunch of guys who are gonna be dead soon?
None###we should tell them
Gregg###ok
Gregg###you get to figure out what we say.
Mae###i'll let you know if i ever come up with anything.
Gregg###sounds good.
None###we shouldn't tell them
Gregg###none of this feels good.
Mae###how could it, man?
Mae###i think it's important that we know at least
Mae###makes it... mean something?
Mae###i dunno how to say it...
Mae###i think we might be the only things in the universe
Mae###who care about anything.
Mae###or who even *can* care.
Mae###do you think any of this means anything?
Mae###or like, meant anything?
Gregg###hm.
Mae###dooooooooes it, greggory?
Angus###hey babies
Gregg###hey hon.
Mae###“babies”?
Gregg###how was work?
Angus###geez, i’m sore from like… everything.
Mae###i ran into like a zillion bushes the other night.
Mae###basically my body hates me right now.
Gregg###gotta do stretches
Mae###so like
Mae###can I move to Bright Harbor with you guys?
Gregg###!
Angus###!
Gregg###uh
Angus###um
Gregg###i thought you like couldn’t leave home?
Mae###eh. You guys are home enough.
Angus###…
Mae###orrrrrr maybe I’ll just visit for a while once you get settled in.
Angus###of course!
Gregg###yeah dude that’d be rad.
Mae###hey guys
Angus###yeah?
Mae###thanks for saving me last night. Like, repeatedly.
Gregg###not even a problem dude.
Gregg###we’ll save you as many times as it takes
Gregg###hey bea.
Mae###heeeey bea.
Bea###...
Mae###aaaare you gonna say something?
Bea###i don’t really know what to say
Bea###what in the hell even happened last night?
None###ugh. Don’t ask me.
Mae###can’t we just like
Mae###play a song
Mae###and get pizza
Mae###and think about this tomorrow?
Bea###i had a dream that the world was ending.
Mae###song. and. pizza.
Bea###alright.
Mae###sweeeeet.
Gregg###it does, dude.
Mae###what?
Gregg###answering your question like 2 minutes ago.
Mae###what question?
Mae###what were we even talking about?
None###uh. Nothing. Nothing at all.
Bea###oh good so i was just having the worst weirdest nightmare ever
Bea###by the way, nice messages to wake up to
Mae###ooooooh god i was half asleep let’s not talk about it
Bea###i think i twisted my ankle last night
Mae###can we just like not talk about last night for the rest of the day?
Bea###uh
Bea###no promises
Mae###can’t we just play a song
Mae###and get pizza
Mae###and talk about this tomorrow?
Angus###sure
Bea###whatever
Bea###we can all talk about it in therapy for years
Mae###that’s the spirit
Mae###i mean we have to go on, right?
Mae###obviously the world is seriously screwed up but
Mae###we’re all gonna die if we don’t keep living
Gregg###that’s some bumper sticker shit right there
Mae###hey, i know what i’m talking about
Mae###we gotta make plans
Mae###we gotta change things
Mae###we gotta play a goddamn song and get a goddamn pizza
Angus###ok so what are we playing?
Bea###god. This door just does not like to open.
Mae###bet it’s worse in the summer.
Mae###oh wow there’s a pentagram on this sticker
Bea###i can’t read the band name on it
Mae###cops... driller?
Bea###i guarantee you it’s not Cops Driller.
Mae###maybe it’s like a german band with a name in english
Mae###sounds like that
Bea###Guten Tag. Ve are Cops-Driller.
Mae###Off Vedersen.
Bea###close enough.
Mae###so did you all get keys to the back door?
Bea###Gregg got one and we made copies.
Mae###how’d he even get a key?
Bea###i have no idea.
Bea###where’s gregg?
Mae###oh yeah he had to “spring” Angus from work
Bea###what does that mean?
Mae###zero clue.
Bea###huh.
Mae###I’m a little unclear about how both of them still have jobs
Mae###since they seem to just up and leave work early a lot.
Bea###There’s a lot about those two I don’t understand.
Mae###I think they just plain need each other.
Bea###Gregg more than Angus I think.
Mae###I don’t think Angus would agree.
Bea###that’s because it wouldn’t occur to Angus to think otherwise
Bea###because Angus is an extremely nice person.
None###Gregg’s a nice person!
Bea###oh yeah he definitely is
Bea###but he’s also bratty and irresponsible
Bea###and has like zero attention span.
Bea###Gregg needs a parent as much as he needs a boyfriend.
Bea###and he’s really lucky Angus is a little bit of both.
None###do you not think they’ll last or something?
Bea###i mean, they’re high school sweethearts!
Bea###once they move and change
Bea###and meet new people
Bea###and become new people
Bea###i think angus is gonna find he’s got more options.
Mae###Angus thinks Gregg, like, *saved* him.
Bea###Listen, I’m not saying he didn’t, if he thinks so.
Bea###Angus might also just be attracted to really sincere guys in leather jackets...
Bea###who carry knives.
Bea###i mean if i met the right guy those would all be plusses.
Mae###geez. You’ve thought this out.
Bea###before you came back
Bea###they were the only people i hung out with most of the time
Bea###i’ve had a lot of time to study.
Bea###so like
Bea###how *are* you?
None###i’m… uh… Good.
Bea###Really?
Mae###I feel like right now I could convince myself I was fine or completely shattered.
Mae###just like… stuck in neutral.
None###i don’t even know
Mae###i’m still processing
Mae###i’m here, though.
Bea###yeah.
Mae###you?
Bea###um. Not great?
Bea###had a dream the world was ending.
Mae###might be.
Bea###do you think we’re safe?
Mae###no idea.
Bea###great feeling.
Mae###yup.
Bea###so like... i’m a little confused about what even happened last night…
None###well, there’s apparently a deathcult of dads
Mae###or was
Mae###who knows if that was all of them
Bea###i can’t believe they even exist. Or existed.
Mae###probably take them a few days to die.
Bea###...
Bea###yup.
Mae###i dunno. I kinda understand them in a weird way.
Bea###really?!
None###the whole cosmic horror thing?
Bea###yeah. That.
Mae###could you even see or feel it?
Bea###nope. But between you and the… dads…
Bea###something had to be going on
Mae###it’s old. It’s very old.
Mae###you can like smell how old.
Mae###it’s like
Mae###a porch light that’s on
Mae###and there are all these bugs around it
Mae###and then the light goes out.
Mae###and there’s a hole where the light was.
Mae###it’s like what happened to me way back.
Mae###like i was telling you about on the couch last night.
Bea###holy crap that was last night.
Bea###seems like 2 lifetimes ago.
Bea###heh heh yeah.
Mae###the world is extremely bad
Bea###yes. Yes it is.
Mae###a… failed state?
Bea###getting pretty close.
Mae###weird question-
Mae###how do you like get up every day
Mae###and go open the store
Mae###and keep doing it?
Bea###i don’t really have a choice, do i?
None###i mean, you definitely do.
Mae###you don’t give yourself enough credit
Mae###you keep all of this running because you care
Bea###i guess.
Bea###caring doesn’t always seem to be voluntary.
Bea###caring can be really terrifying
Bea###i feel like it’s always there right out of sight
Bea###following me.
None###i guess not.
Mae###but still. Lots of people would be like
Mae###destroyed by what you’ve been through.
Bea###my mom was extremely tough. And smart.
Bea###when i found out she was going to die
Bea###it just didn’t occur to me that she was fragile
Bea###like we’re all fragile.
Bea###i don’t want to let her down i guess.
Bea###i can’t *not* give a shit.
Bea###i mean i do the store
Bea###and our bills at home
Bea###stuff with the chamber of commerce
Bea###i’m doing free study courses online
Bea###and i’m a member of the young socialists.
Mae###i sleep a lot and sometimes eat pizza.
Bea###“to each according to their ability”
Mae###well, on the bright side, you got meeeee!
Bea###heh heh yeah.
Mae###we can fix the world togetherrrrrr!
Bea###yup. Fix it right up.
Mae###we fixed that furnace!
Bea###*I* fixed that furnace.
Mae###well i fixed us getting trapped in the basement.
Bea###you sure did, Mae. you sure did.
Bea###ugh. I guess last night wasn’t so weird.
Mae###it was pretty weird.
Bea###old men killing the youngs and the poors
Bea###to get back some past that barely existed.
Bea###same ol same ol
Bea###they’re like ghosts in some old mansion
Bea###killing the new owners.
Bea###makes you want to either give up or try harder.
Mae###or get really upset and take a nap
Bea###yeah. Naps fix everything.
Mae###or like drop an elevator on them
Bea###that works too i guess.
Mae###god i can’t even wrap my head around these past two weeks.
Bea###i think that’s pretty understandable, mae.
Mae###there were these three weird teens
Mae###and they told me i’d see bunch of pentagrams.
Bea###what teens?
Mae###the ones we bumped into in the graveyard
Bea###oh god. Those teens.
Mae###met them up by the water tower
Mae###just some dorky kids.
Mae###anyway, they said if I saw three pentagrams
Mae###I’d get some sort of help.
Mae###I actually saw one at that party we went to.
Mae###and last night, i saw the last one down in the tunnel
Mae###and it made me think…
Mae###you remember Adina and The Frozen Lake?
Bea###the folk tale? Yeah sure.
Mae###that astronomer under the ice or whatever that couldn’t find a star
Mae###until after she died?
Bea###the ghost star.
Mae###just thinking stars are upside down if you’re looking at their reflections.
Bea###that’s… true.
Mae###which is what you’d see if you were a reflection in the ice-
Bea###yeah i get it. I read the story.
Mae###i barely noticed it when we were down there last night but today
Mae###just thinking about that. This feeling like
Mae###at the end of everything you can hold on to something.
Mae###or anything.
Mae###find the spooky ghost star
Mae###put it on a map
Mae###then you… uh… have a map?
Mae###i dunno. I’m hungry and tired
Mae###and i feel like i got run over by a train that was carrying other trains.
Bea###i’m really impressed you got all of that out of teens being weird and spooky.
Mae###pattern-seekers.
Bea###what?
Mae###something angus said.
Mae###we’re good at finding patterns.
Bea###yeah. It’s like a survival thing.
Mae###yeah.
Mae###i dunno.
Mae###it meant something to me.
Mae###is that enough?
Bea###far be it from me to condemn spooky meaning.
Mae###spooky.
Mae###spoooook-k-k-k-y
Mae###there’s this kid Lori
Mae###i’ve been like… uh…
Mae###maybe trying to be a role model?
Bea###how old is she?
Mae###i think 15 or so.
Bea###so you’re just hanging out with a 15 year old?
Mae###oh shut up. Anyway.
Mae###she does this thing where she puts little metal dudes on the train tracks
Mae###and like squashes them together
Mae###and it makes these rad little monsters.
Bea###oooh that sounds cool.
Mae###yeah it’s awesome.
Mae###it also made me think like
Mae###if they were alive when it happened
Bea###god, that’s grim
Mae###if they were just destroyed and crushed by this massive unknowable thing
Mae###and crammed into being one thing
Mae###they’re like a new monster.
Bea###twice the monster, even.
Mae###like me and the fort lucenne fish god
Bea###i think you actually injured a few of those people
Mae###eh.
Mae###anyway
Mae###but like look at where we live
Mae###big giant things rolled over this place
Mae###and i don’t know if it made us all stronger
Mae###or just made some monsters
Bea###i… think it did both.
Bea###like anything traumatic on that scale does both?
Bea###but as much as i hate this shithole sometimes
Bea###it’s home.
Mae###Remember when Mrs. Crangler taught us to squaredance in girl scouts?
Bea###ha ha yeah. Geez. she had that stick
Mae###yeah she’d hit the ground to the beat
Bea###Mrs. Crangler was serious about squaredancing.
Mae###she died recently i guess.
Bea###yeah. She was extremely old though.
Mae###squaredancing was weird
Mae###all of us just like jumbled up
Mae###trying to dance, trying not to trip over each other
Bea###Mrs. Crangler is dead, but the squaredance lives on.
Mae###i wonder if Lori knows how to squaredance.
Mae###we should teach her?
Bea###oh, am i being drafted into this makeshift sisterhood?
Mae###sisterhood of squaredancing monsters
Bea###we’ll rule the floor at the state farm show
Mae###we’ll rule any floor we lay our eyes on.
Mae###so i went to Germ’s house.
Bea###WHAT?!
Bea###oh my god tell me about it
Bea###i can’t believe he even has a house.
Mae###oh yeah, he does. He’s from somewhere.
Mae###uh it’s a big double-wide with a built-on basement and a deck
Mae###really nice, actually.
Mae###he’s got a trampoline.
Bea###oof. bouncing on those always makes me sick.
Mae###anyway his grandma lives there
Mae###she told my fortune. sorta.
Bea###holy shit.
Bea###what was your fortune?
Mae###well she said some pretty shitty things about my whole
Mae###you know. head thing.
Bea###ah.
Mae###but otherwise it was kinda vaguely... what happened last night?
Bea###wow. spooky.
Bea###you know, if you go back in regional history and stuff
Bea###there’s like stories about witches and stuff
Mae###you believe in witches?
Bea###oh geez don’t ask me what i believe in today
Bea###but yeah. It’s in the history books.
Mae###so you’re telling me she was actually psychic
Bea###how would that even work?
Bea###does that mean the future is just set?
Mae###maybe it’s the future depending on what choices we make
Bea###but if the choices haven’t been made yet that’s part of the future
Bea###so it should be part of the… something...
Bea###uuuugh. My brain.
Mae###no, that’s a good point. Didn’t think about that.
Mae###well anyway. What she said was scary but
Mae###it was nice to feel like there was some sort of order to all of this.
Mae###like when i picked out dinner the other night
Mae###was that like the only dinner i could have picked?
Mae###were we like, destined to get trapped in Mrs. miranda’s basement?
Bea###god, i hope not.
None###yeah
Bea###thinking that the future is just like an equation playing out
Bea###it’s really claustrophobic, right?
Mae###yeah.
None###why not?
Bea###i don’t want my mom to have to have died.
Bea###i don’t want me to have to have missed college.
Bea###i don’t want the Pickaxe to be some hard-coded destiny.
Mae###hm. Yeah.
Mae###eff that noise.
Bea###eff it right into the stratosphere.
Mae###remember that story… uh… adina and the frozen lake?
Bea###isn’t it Adina and The Forest God?
Mae###ok whatever.
Mae###there were these weird teens
Bea###i don’t remember that part of the story
Mae###no dummy, this part actually happened
Bea###i know. I was joking.
Mae###i don’t know how to interpret jokes today!
Bea###ok so you saw some teens
Mae###anyway they were being all spooky
Mae###actually you met them- in the graveyard
Bea###oh THOSE teens.
Bea###the teens that tortured you
Mae###yeah. Them.
Mae###they told me i’d see some pentagrams, and then it happened?
Mae###i think they’re like witches or something.
Bea###you think they’re... uh... psychic?
Mae###i dunno. I think they’re just weird.
Mae###but i saw the last pentagram when we were down there last night.
Mae###it was like in the tunnel supports where the… hole… was.
Mae###angus would laugh at that
Mae###say i’m just pattern-seeking
Bea###yeah that’s angus. He’d say it nicely though.
Mae###it didn’t really register much with me at the moment
Mae###but like in that story there’s like a dead astronomer or something
Mae###and they’re like a reflection in the ice
Mae###and there’s this star they can’t see until they’re dead
Bea###yeah. The ghost star.
Mae###and if you saw a reflection of the ghost star it’d be like a pentagram.
Bea###that is true.
Mae###i dunno. There’s this other kid, Lori Meyers.
Mae###we were hanging out by the tracks
Bea###so you’re just hanging out with teenagers all over the place.
Mae###oh hush.
Mae###so lori like squishes these little metal dudes on the train tracks
Mae###and they become like these cool little monsters.
Bea###oh that’s cool.
Mae###yeah Lori’s pretty rad.
Mae###but watching her do that, it felt like this… uh… ritual?
Mae###like what was that old magic where they tried to make gold out of shit?
Bea###alchemy.
Mae###yeah. It was like alkamee. She was like doing magic.
Bea###so you’re saying you’ve met like 4 witches.
Mae###not real ones but
Mae###i don’t know what i’m getting at.
Mae###when i felt like everything was over, like there was no hope
Mae###remembering like… ghost stars and adina and teen witches
Mae###and lori making monsters out of toy people and real trains
Mae###just suddenly felt like life was happening
Mae###and teens were doing weird magic.
Mae###so things couldn’t be that hopeless.
Bea###this is like those inspirational stories religious people put in books
Bea###and like old people read them
Bea###about how angels like stopped a car from hitting them
Bea###or sold them a house for almost no money
Bea###except your angels are teen dipshits
Mae###you work with what you have i guess.
Bea###hm.
Mae###you believe in like psychics and shit?
Mae###oh wait sorry we already talked about this.
Bea###when?
Mae###at the graveyard the other night!
Mae###you said you might believe in ghosts and stuff
Bea###“and shit?”
Mae###just like… supernatural shit in general?
Bea###sure yeah i’m open to it. Kinda. whatever.
Mae###remember the weird teens we met there?
Bea###ha ha yeah the ones that like tortured you?
Mae###yeah. Them.
Mae###i met them before.
Mae###so i met these three weird teens
Mae###out by the watertower
Mae###they were all spooky and shit
Mae###they said i’d like see some pentagrams and i’d get like some sort of help.
Mae###i think they’re witches.
Bea###that’s weird and friendly.
Mae###ok, hold that thought- the other day I went to Germ’s house, and-
Bea###HOLY SHIT!!!
Bea###you want to GERM’S HOUSE?!?!?
Bea###what’s it like?
Mae###it’s nice. It’s like a doublewide with a finished basement.
Mae###got a trampoline.
Bea###oof. bouncing on those always makes me sick.
Mae###i effin loved it dude.
Mae###i bounced so high and talked about like unions with his dad and uncle
Bea###this all sounds amazing.
Mae###anyway his grandma told my fortune. sorta.
Bea###holy shit.
Bea###what was your fortune?
Mae###well she said some pretty shitty things about my whole
Mae###you know. head thing.
Bea###ah.
Mae###but otherwise it was kinda vaguely... what happened last night?
Bea###wow.
Mae###yeah.
Mae###when I was down there last night,
Mae###i saw the last of the pentagrams.
Mae###it was in the support beams
Mae###Angus would laugh if I told him
Mae###he’d talk about how i’m just pattern-seeking.
Bea###yeah that sounds like Angus.
Mae###when i saw it i didn’t like really register it until today
Mae###and it was like whoa
Mae###the teens were right
Mae###germ’s grandma was... a quarter right? something like that?
Bea###was what they said helpful?
Mae###yeah... i felt like i like wasn’t alone in this
Mae###i mean you were all there
Mae###but this was help like... inside my head
Mae###like the fact that someone knew about all of this
Mae###and were trying to help me
Mae###like they’re *all* witches
Mae###and like... i don’t believe in magic really but… i dunno
Bea###sounds like you believe in magic
Mae###i for real don’t.
Bea###you believe in witches
Mae###no
Bea###you are all witched up omg
Mae###ok forget it
Bea###mae.
Mae###yeah?
Bea###i’m glad you’re ok.
Mae###thanks.
Mae###so i went to germ’s house the other day.
Bea###OH MY GOD!!!!!!
Bea###I like can’t even picture where he would live.
Bea###like in a treehouse somewhere?
Mae###nah, it’s nice.
Mae###it’s like a double-wide with a built on basement
Mae###got a trampoline
Bea###oof. I get pukey on those.
Mae###it was awesome. We ate sloppy joes.
Bea###mmmm. I could go for one of those right about now.
Mae###god, they’re so good.
Mae###like you forget about them until you hear someone mention it
Mae###and suddenly that’s all you want.
Mae###shoulda just made those for dinner at your place the other night
Bea###ooooh yeah
Bea###hey sorry again about yelling at you.
Mae###oh don’t worry i already forgot that entire conversation.
Bea###oh.
Mae###anyway, before all that
Mae###his grandma told my fortune. sorta.
Bea###holy shit.
Bea###what was your fortune?
Mae###well she said some pretty shitty things about my whole
Mae###you know. head thing.
Bea###ah.
Mae###but otherwise it was kinda vaguely... what happened last night?
Bea###wow.
Mae###but it wasn’t so much what she said, but more like, who she was
Bea###who was she?
Mae###just an old lady getting involved in all this weirdness. For some reason.
Bea###uh huh.
Mae###ok so also there’s this kid, Lori, that I’ve been hanging out with?
Bea###“kid”?
Mae###like 15 or something.
Bea###so you’re just hanging with children and the elderly these days?
Mae###anyway.
Mae###Lori lives over by the tracks
Mae###and i don’t think her home life is great.
Mae###at all.
Mae###but she’s awesome. Loves horror movies.
Mae###makes these little monsters by putting little metal dudes on the tracks
Bea###oh and they get all squished and stretched? That’s rad.
Mae###yeah see? Cool kid.
Mae###then she’ll take like two of them and squash ‘em together.
Bea###doublemonster.
Mae###i feel like i’m kind of an older sister to her when we hang out?
Mae###My grandma died a while back
Mae###and germ’s grandma was trying to grandma me.
Mae###and you’re like my... sister? Cousin?
Bea###the crazy uncle.
Mae###ok whatever.
Mae###point being: we’re all stuck together like Lori’s squashed monster guys
Mae###like you and me and like Germ’s grandma and lori and
Bea###gonna add like Mrs. Miranda in there?
Mae###no. she makes mummies. That’s not allowed.
Bea###so we’re all part of… something?
Mae###we’re all a part of the same squashed monster.
Bea###deep.
Mae###the world is extremely messed up, huh?
Bea###yes. Yes it is.
Mae###a… failed state?
Bea###getting pretty close.
Mae###my granddad, before he died
Mae###his last words were like “This house is haunted”
Bea###ok that’s spooky. Was he in your house?
Mae###no, he was like looking out the window at the hospital.
Mae###but i think i get what he meant.
Mae###this whole… place.
Mae###the other day I ran into these three weird teens
Mae###actually wait you met them too
Mae###at the graveyard.
Bea###ha ha ha yeah. The ones that tortured you.
Mae###yeah them.
Mae###they told me i’d see a bunch of pentagrams and it’d like “aid” me
Mae###i think they’re witches.
Mae###and then it actually happened?
Bea###how… so?
Mae###i dunno. I saw the last of them in the tunnel last night.
Mae###made from like the support beams.
Mae###Angus would say it was pattern-seeking
Bea###that sounds like angus. He’d say it nicely though.
Mae###when i saw it it reminded me of something
Mae###didn’t really register until this morning-
Mae###remember Adina and the Frozen lake?
Bea###the folk tale? I think it’s called Adina and the Forest God.
Mae###whatever. Remember how there was like a dead astronomer
Mae###who was like a reflection in the ice?
Bea###yeah. Uh. looking for a star you could only see when you’re dead.
Bea###the Ghost Star.
Bea###my mom had a ghost star tattoo.
Mae###anyway, like if you’re looking at a reflection of a star from below
Mae###it’s gonna look kinda like a pentagram
Bea###that’s… true?
Mae###woke up this morning and was like oh wow
Mae###i feel like i  found my ghost star
Mae###and then lived.
Bea###and this is because of teen witches?
Mae###ok see i thought that was dumb BUT
Mae###I met Germ’s grandma.
Bea###WHAT?????
Mae###yeah I went to his house!
Bea###What’s it like????
Mae###um it’s nice?
Mae###double wide with a finished basement.
Mae###got a trampoline.
Bea###ugh. bouncing on those things makes me sick.
Mae###anyway his grandma told my fortune. sorta.
Bea###holy shit.
Bea###what was your fortune?
Mae###well she said some pretty shitty things about my whole
Mae###you know. head thing.
Bea###ah.
Mae###but otherwise it was kinda vaguely... what happened last night?
Bea###wow.
Mae###yeah see? So like I’m thinking, maybe *she’s* a witch too.
Mae###not like an actual witch. The teens aren’t *real* witches either.
Bea###so...
Mae###there’s this other kid, Lori M. we’ve been hanging out.
Bea###you just hanging with teens all over the place these days?
Mae###hush. I’m like a role model.
Bea###oh well then.
Mae###Lori does this thing where she puts little metal dudes on the train tracks.
Bea###oooh! And the train squishes them? That’s so cool.
Mae###yeah she’s great.
Mae###i dunno. Maybe this is just me not being a kid anymore
Mae###but watching her do that. Open her little bag
Mae###and pull out these things
Mae###and then like using actual trains
Mae###making little monsters.
Mae###i came to the only logical conclusion.
Mae###Witch.
Bea###Well gee Mae you seem to be just swimming in witches.
Mae###Hey listen you could be one too.
Bea###oh god i wish. I have some hexes to hand out.
Mae###and I mean obviously i count as a witch. I’m like spooky magic all the way.
Bea###of course
Mae###i dunno. Last night, today…
Mae###everything is extremely bad here right now.
Mae###everything is bad in the world.
Bea###guys last night,
Bea###they’re like ghosts in an old mansion
Bea###don’t know they’re dead
Bea###just stalking around killing whoever moves in.
Mae###like granddad said. It’s haunted.
Mae###but there’s also a lot of witches in it.
Mae###and that makes me feel a tiny bit better.
Bea###so the entire rust belt is just lousy with ghosts and witches?
Mae###yeah but not all ghosts are bad, like… i mean… ugh.
Mae###I don’t really know where I’m going with this. It’s been a long week.
Bea###it’s fine.
Mae###so,
Mae###have you had any new… uh… rat problems at the shop?
Bea###uh… yeah. How did you know?
Mae###I heard there were some rats around town.
Mae###makes me happy for some reason.
Bea###well there’s no such thing as a small rat problem
Bea###there’s just gonna be more of them
Mae###Hope springs. Rats Multiply.
Bea###cute. we literally sell rat poison.
Bea###they’re going down
Mae###we’ll see.
Mae###hey, speaking of nothing,
Mae###how good is your car?
Bea###good how?
Mae###like, can it drive real far?
Bea###Mae do you know anything ab-… what?
Mae###we should like do a roooooad trip.
Bea###to where?
Mae###out west
Mae###it gets all flat
Bea###that it does.
Mae###we can go where it’s really flat
None###and they sell barbeque.
Bea###i think BBQ is south
Mae###not all of it
Mae###it’s everywhere, Bea-Bea-Q.
Mae###all different kinds. Dry. Wet. Ultra.
None###and you can see like the world’s largest pierogi.
Mae###or a museum of toy rocket ships
Mae###or a factory where they make pretzels
Mae###or a house that looks like a big chicken!
Bea###i could… ok let’s talk about it next year
Mae###i’ll start planning it now.
Bea###i thought you couldn’t leave home because of your… issue?
Mae###eh. You’re home enough.
Mae###i mean if we’re trapped here together
Mae###we might as well be trapped out there together.
Mae###i mean if we’re not dead by then. L O L.
Bea###you have a way of making doom sound like a lot of fun, maeday.
Bea###that is actually kind of a gift.
Gregg###GODDAMN THIS DOOR!
Angus###I think god already has.
Mae###there they are!
Angus###hey guys.
Gregg###sup nerds.
None###pssh. It’s you who are the nerds.
Gregg###whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
Angus###geez. We’ve never been so insulted.
Gregg###take it right back, dork.
Mae###fat chance.
None###how did you get Angus out of work?
Gregg###i made up a family emergency.
Angus###my uncle got run over by a tractor.
Mae###ha ha wow.
Angus###i mean he did in real life too but that was years ago.
Bea###hey gregg, so…
Bea###i didn’t really know Casey.
Gregg###…
Gregg###yeah.
Bea###I just wanted to say I’m really sorry.
Gregg###yeah.
Gregg###thanks.
Gregg###Casey was a good one.
Mae###Casey was good.
Bea###should we like… tell his parents?
None###probably?
Angus###what do we tell them?
Mae###i dunno.
Mae###can we like… make up something that sounds real?
Bea###oh what, the truth isn’t real enough?
Bea###no you’re right the truth is insane
None###no????
Mae###i mean, tell them what?
Bea###uh. Ok yeah.
Bea###hm
Bea###good point.
Angus###so like, what do we do?
Mae###about Casey?
Angus###no, like, in general
Mae###can we think about this tomorrow?
Mae###can we just play a song and get a pizza?
Bea###i don’t think “song and pizza” is an answer, really.
Mae###can we just be normal for like one day?
Bea###i don’t know how today can possibly feel normal.
None###when i was in that coma or whatever
Mae###i saw the future
Mae###or maybe it’s now the future
Mae###or was the future
Angus###like flying cars and shit?
Angus###actually those would be a disaster
Gregg###ha ha FINALLY you admit it. You owe me 5 bucks.
Angus###bet’s a bet.
Mae###no, it was like the town was abandoned
Mae###like being eaten and reclaimed by nature or some shit
Mae###i went to where my house used to be
Mae###when i was there i felt completely hopeless
Mae###but now i think i could just build another house.
Mae###or i could just move on.
Mae###knowing when to hold on
Mae###and when to let go
Mae###…
Mae###ok i lost my entire train of thought.
Mae###i had it for a second.
Mae###then it was gone.
Bea###song and pizza sounds good, mae.
Gregg###song and pizza.
Mae###yeah.
Mae###good enough.
None###when i was down there last night
Mae###i like made the decision not to die
Mae###or at least not to die without a fight
Mae###and the… thing down there…
Mae###told me nothing would save me forever
Bea###wait, it was like, talking to you?
Mae###it’s been talking to me for a long time.
Mae###i just didn’t know what it was.
Mae###but anyway like nothing is gonna save us forever
Mae###but a lot of things can save us today.
Angus###that’s really pretty, mae.
Mae###ha ha thanks i totally made it up
Mae###like right on the spot last night
Bea###i said it before. You’re good with doom.
Gregg###doom doom doom
Mae###so anyway. Song and pizza.
Mae###we earned it by still being alive for another day
Bea###that’s a decent reason.
Gregg###decent.
Angus###decent.
Mae###decent.
Mae###...and anyway i don't even know if they're dreams or not.
Mae###and this guy, who i think was a ghost
Mae###kidnapped some kid and also i think was in my head after
Mae###while i was sleeping
Mae###and anyway yeah I think I need to do something
Mae###because this is scary.
Bea###well that's not what i was expecting to hear tonight.
Gregg###are you ok, dude?
None###yeah!
Mae###i'm not like losing it or something.
None###no!
Mae###i'm kinda freaked out!
Angus###it probably wasn't a ghost.
Gregg###yeah probably not.
Bea###yeah definitely.
Mae###uuuugh.
Mae###ok fine I'll go figure this out myself.
Gregg###aw dude don't be like that.
Angus###you got us!
Mae###aw... dudes...
Bea###ok fine.
Mae###so we need to maybe see
Mae###if there's like
Mae###some ghosty stuff happening around here?
Mae###like, from a source we can trust.
Angus###such as...
Mae###does the newspaper have like a ghost section?
Mae###What? Why is that a dumb question?
Bea###you know, we could go check the Library.
Mae###for... books? about it?
Bea###no, they have the local paper on file
Bea###going back a century.
Bea###if there's some secret history of kidnapper ghosts
Bea###we'll find it there probably.
Mae###oh wow! i didn't know they had that!
Mae###i thought it was just like a broken down old bunch of books?
Bea###when's the last time you were at the library?
Bea###we actually have one of the nicer ones around.
Mae###oh. how?
Bea###rich dude who paid for it way back when?
Bea###yeah they set up a foundation, and...
Mae###?
Bea###nevermind. let's go.
Mae###can we regroup after?

Gregg###Yeah! I kinda think you do!
Mae###Since when?
Mae###What are you even doing in here?
Gregg###Getting you!

BeaDad###Ha ha! They raised you right, then! What happened?
Mae###I have no idea.
None###I like hockey.
BeaDad###Hockey? Pssh.
Mae###What’s not to like about hockey?
BeaDad###Buncha men prancing around on ice skates.
Mae###And beating the living crap out of each other!
BeaDad###eeeeh. Can’t get excited about a puck.
Mae###But... but it’s like *expected* that someone is gonna be bleeding by the end!
BeaDad###No sportsmanship in it.
Mae###How is what I described *not* sportsmanship?
BeaDad###Eeeeeh.

BeaDad###Nah, I got sandwich stuff.
Bea###Alright.
Mae###Aw, did I ruin dinner?
BeaDad###Yep, but we’ll live I think!
BeaDad###HA HA HA!!
BeaDad###I don't think the fish worked out.
Mae###I thought hey fish is ok, Bakey Shakey is good...
BeaDad###I think Bakey Shakey needs something... else.
Mae###I thought like... uh... two good things...
Mae###probably make one really good thing?
BeaDad###I don't think ground beef was meant to stand alone.
Bea###Like, in a pile.
Mae###Awwwwww...
BeaDad###I think I might actually be a little ill.
Mae###I thought like... fish is good! Chicken is good!
Bea###Not like this. Not like this.
Mae###No. Ok.
Mae###If you go to Admiral Fry's and order the number 7.
Mae###IT'S CHICKEN AND FISH!
Bea###Yeah but they're separate. And fried.
Mae###uuuurgh
Bea###I can see the thought process here.
Bea###with the Bakey Shakey.
Mae###Chicken and cream of chicken!
Mae###Creamy chicken!
Bea###and you're thinking hey
Bea###how do I improve this.
Mae###Yeah see you get it.
BeaDad###I don't think pork and chicken were supposed to meet this way.
Mae###Aw, really?
BeaDad###I don't think creamy beef and chicken soup
BeaDad###is gonna win you any blue ribbons at the fair.
Mae###Oh come on I GUARANTEE this is an actual recipe.
Mae###Am I just bad at everything?
Bea###No, just fixing things and planning meals.
Mae###Those are big life skills!
Bea###Did you like it?
Mae###No I agree it is very terrible.
BeaDad###This’s ok.
Mae###Thanks!
Bea###Yeah it’s alright.
Mae###Thanks.
BeaDad###Yeah it’ll do.

Mae###i mean, i can't really tell?
Mae###and i don't think the ghosts were like
Mae###people?

Mae###Steve, you *ARE* an asshole.
SteveScriggins###What is your problem with me?
Mae###Back in school? You were such a bully!
Mae###You made people's lives miserable!
Mae###and now, years later, you're what-
Mae###ripping apart buildings for scrap?
Mae###like, actively destroying the town?
SteveScriggins###ok well you can just stop right there
SteveScriggins###you know the only reason anyone in town remembers you
SteveScriggins###is because you nearly killed a kid, right?
SteveScriggins###like, his face is still kinda messed up!
SteveScriggins###i never did *ANYTHING* like that
SteveScriggins###and you and Gregg have smashed plenty of shit
SteveScriggins###all over the place, just for fun
SteveScriggins###you think i'd be in here doing this if i didn't need the cash?
None###I-
None###uh
SteveScriggins###you're like my niece, a big stupid baby
SteveScriggins###just walking around bumping into stuff.
SteveScriggins###and yeah i know what people say about me
SteveScriggins###and yeah i probably did some bad stuff
SteveScriggins###but at least *I* can admit that.
SteveScriggins###you're no better than me.
SteveScriggins###you're just more in love with yourself.
SteveScriggins###or you're stupider.
SteveScriggins###can't say which.
SteveScriggins###don't care.
Mae###Ok, I think it's-
SteveScriggins###SHUT. UP.

Saleem###Thanks for making this happen, kid.
Mae###ha ha wow
Mae###...
Mae###...
Mae###huh.
Sadie###what?
Mae###I just realized that like...
Mae###I did something helpful.
Mae###Like I came up with a plan and did something good.
Saleem###Is that strange?
Mae###I feel like I just stumble into things all the time
Mae###introducing you two is like...
Mae###I *MEANT* to help out two strangers. And I did.
Mae###And now you’re gonna play together
Mae###and fall in love...
Sadie###What? No.
Saleem###I’m in a long term monogamous relationship.
Sadie###I am not in the market.
Sadie###And my son takes up most of my attention.
Mae###Oh.
Mae###Did I make it weird?
Saleem###You made it weird.
Sadie###Very weird.
Mae###dammit
Mae###Um. Hello.
Sadie###Hello.
Mae###I'm Mae.
Sadie###Sadie.
Mae###what are you doing up here?
Sadie###what are *YOU* doing up here?
None###exploring
Sadie###same way I found it.
None###i mean... do i need a reason?
Sadie###nope.
Sadie###did you know
Sadie###this is the only stage in town.
None###are you on stage a lot?
Sadie###nope. not for a long, long time at least
None###that's not true!
Mae###we just did a play at the hardware store!
Mae###we used the counter as a stage!
Sadie###ok, this is the only stage in town
Sadie###that's only a stage.
Mae###looks like no one's played here in a long time
Sadie###yeah, been a few decades.
Mae###are you gonna like
Mae###put on something here?
Sadie###oh, i don't think anyone's gonna be putting anything on here
Sadie###at least not anytime soon.
Sadie###no electricity, probably structurally unsound.
Sadie###infested with rats and pigeons.
Mae###other than the electricity that's like most of the town.
Sadie###ha ha ha
Sadie###that it is. that it is.
Mae###Hi again.
Sadie###It’s you, kid.
Mae###I’m actually 20.
Sadie###I’m 38. You’re a kid.
Mae###Ok.
Mae###How'd you find this place?
Sadie###I mean I knew this was up here since I was a kid
Sadie###but only got up the nerve to break in recently
Mae###why is that?
Sadie###not getting any younger
Sadie###and this place could fall in any day
Sadie###you get to a point in life
Sadie###where the number of first-evers gets lower
Sadie###and the number of never-agains gets higher
Sadie###i dunno
Mae###i know what you mean
Sadie###no you don't.
Mae###do you have a job or something?
Sadie###i did.
Sadie###had some troubles, though.
Sadie###living with my parents for now
Sadie###me and my kid
Sadie###so i got a little free time.
Mae###same with me, actually.
Mae###except no kid.
Sadie###small world.
Mae###Funny.
Sadie###What?
Mae###I just met this guy over by the church steps
Mae###he was also hanging by himself
Mae###and playing music.
Sadie###Small world.
Mae###Heh heh. Well...
Mae###Small town at least.
Sadie###Definitely.
Mae###See ya.
Mae###you know, that guy across town?

Sadie###no, it's fine.
Sadie###what's he play?
Mae###violin? fiddle? are they the same?
Sadie###huh. ok.
Sadie###Well, if you see him again, tell him to stop by.
Sadie###unless he’s a creep or something
Mae###he doesn’t seem like a creep.
Sadie###well, I got mace.
Mae###I just met this guy over by the church steps
Mae###he was also hanging by himself
Mae###and playing music.
Sadie###Small world.
Mae###I told him about you.
Mae###Playing over here.
Mae###By your lonesome.
Sadie###Oh. OK.
Mae###Maybe you could play together????
Sadie###Do you know anything about this guy?
Mae###He's not a murderer.
Mae###I don't think he's a murderer.
Sadie###Ok well... thanks?
Mae###This wasn’t here before.
Sadie###Yeah! Found them backstage.
Saleem###Can’t believe they’re still intact.
Saleem###Must be 60... 70 years old now?
Mae###“The Original Deep Hollow Hollerers”
Sadie###Try saying *that* three times fast
None###Deep Hollow Hollerers
Mae###Deep Hollow Hollellers
None###Deep Hollow Hollerers Deep Hollow Hollerers
Mae###Deep Hollow Hollellers Deep Hollol Horellers
None###Deep Hollow Hollerers Deep Hollow Hollerers Deep Hollow Hollerers
Mae###Deep Hollow Hollellers Deep Hollol Horellers Deep Hloler Hollerwers
Saleem###*ahem*
Saleem###DEEP. HOLLOW. HOLLER-ERS.
Sadie###D. H. H.
Mae###Who are they?
Saleem###Geez kid, how long have you lived here?
None###My whole life!
Saleem###Well then you got no excuse.
None###I’m 20.
Sadie###You look younger.
Sadie###You’ll appreciate that later in life.
Saleem###The Deep Hollor Horrelors - goddammit
Mae###HA HA.
Saleem###The D.H.H. were *THE* premier dance band in Deep Hollow County
Sadie###This was their club.
Sadie###Four of ‘em. Violin, sax, tuba, accordion.
Saleem###Polkas, Waltzes, old tunes from the hills.
Saleem###20’s through the 40’s.
Saleem###Took this town through some hard times.
Saleem###They were on that famous anthology of appalachian music from the 60s.
Sadie###Yeah. Big piece of local history.
None###What happened to them?
Sadie###oh yeah
Sadie###weird story there
None###What happened to this place?
Sadie###After they were found out in the woods
Sadie###it passed from owner to owner for a long time
Mae###“Found”? “Out in the woods?”
Sadie###oh yeah. Uh.
Sadie###Weird story there.
Saleem###They got spooky.
Sadie###or kinda religious?
None###spooky?
Saleem###yeah they talked about taking trips out of their bodies
Saleem###and were playing for the ghosts that have been through here.
Mae###huh.
Saleem###folks thought they were just being weird and poetic but
None###religious?
Sadie###yeah they started talking about how
Sadie###they were playing for gods?
Sadie###but like gods nobody knew about?
Sadie###and they were taking trips out of their bodies?
Saleem###who knows. They were also getting kind of old.
Mae###that's weird.
Sadie###In the end they stopped coming here
Sadie###and started playing out in the woods
Sadie###on these little… band box thingies they built
Saleem###Or at least that’s what people figured
Saleem###In November of ‘49 they found them dead way out there
Saleem###Died of exposure!
Saleem###Frost froze ‘em to their instruments!
Sadie###Had to peel ‘em off the ground.
Saleem###One of the great wtf moments in Possum Springs history.
Mae###Holy crap.
Sadie###How have you not heard this story?
Mae###No it’s just...
Mae###I...
Mae###nothing. The world is big and weird.
Saleem###After they were gone this place’s days were numbered.
Saleem###And now! for the first time in god knows how long!
Saleem###The Husker Bee Ballroom shall hear music again!
Sadie###Ha ha ha.
Saleem###And it’s a full house! Pigeons appreciate quality!
Mae###This makes me happy.
Sadie###Save the happiness for when we’re good.
Saleem###Yeah. Let’s get good.
Sadie###This place could use some good.
Saleem###Well, that's one thing about music-
Saleem###it fills empty space!
Mae###holy shit. That’s a lot of birds.
Mae###wow.
Mae###people used to like
Mae###come here.
Mae###Whoa. Pentagram.

Mae###i like *feel* it, though?
Mae###wish everyone just believed me.
Mae###thank you, rabies. your support means a lot.
Mae###you're a good-ass possum, rabies.
Mae###alright, I'm off!
Mae###stay safe! eat some trash!
Mae###and common pests!
Mae###hey Rabies.
Mae###how's life?
Mae###that's good to hear.
Mae###back in school we had to write this thing
Mae###Like, if you could be anywhere in… uh… 15 years, where would you be?
Mae###and it was an easy assignment
Mae###because i drew it when i was 15
Mae###and it hasn’t changed
Mae###except it was 20 years then
Mae###i’m on a farm. Or something like that.
Mae###but not with like animals or crops or something
Mae###maybe corn? I like corn fields
Mae###maybe here, maybe in like Idaho or something
Mae###and we’re there- she’s there- in the drawing she’s a she
Mae###and we’re married, or no… like, whatever they do in Idaho
Mae###my teacher wrote "i think they just get married"
Mae###but no like i mean out on the frontier
Mae###you just stay with someone long enough that it’s a thing.
Mae###whatever. I can call it what i want.
Mae###anyway, we go out and wander around and do work together
Mae###and we come home and we’re all gross
Mae###and your face feels like it does when it’s been windy all day
Mae###it’s cold out
Mae###and we order pizza
Mae###my teacher was like "on a farm? in idaho?"
Mae###yeah there’s a town nearby in this drawing
Mae###it was a big drawing.
Mae###and we eat pizza and I’m playing a video game
Mae###and she’s making something
Mae###like she does woodworking or she’s a blacksmith or something
Mae###so she has really rough hands
Mae###Teacher was like "She’s doing woodworking and-or blacksmithing in the living room?"
Mae###and she has boots but like
Mae###mine are muddy
Mae###but hers are all scuffed up from work
Mae###from the wood. Or the fire. Or something.
Mae###and we have 2 big burly cats from a barn
Mae###and a dog
Mae###and we all howl at the moon together
Mae###parts of it I’ve wanted since I was a kid
Mae###the cats and the dog at least
Mae###no children
Mae###no children
Mae###no children
Mae###how about you, rabies?
Mae###does rabies want babies?
Mae###do you have big plans?
Mae###mmm. too true, rabies. too true.
Mae###alright, i'm off!
Mae###thanks for saying hello!
Mae###see ya around! be safe and eat trash!
Mae###and common pests!
Mae###Farming.
Mae###I could farm.
Mae###If I stay in town long enough
Mae###I could see getting into the farm life.
Mae###the problem with farms
Mae###is the amount of poop.
Mae###like even if you don't have animals.
Mae###you actually buy poop or something
Mae###and shovel it all over the place.
Mae###it's madness.
Mae###it's poop madness.
Mae###After this, a few miles and you go under the highway
Mae###and it's just rolling fields and farms.
Mae###I missed the corn mazes this fall.
Mae###And the haunted barn in Briddle.
Mae###always next year.
Mae###for campfires and corndogs.
Mae###weird that town ends like
Mae###*BAM!*
Mae###right here.
Mae###there's like a line
Mae###somewhere
Mae###that no one can see.
Mae###but you can put it on a map.
Mae###wonder if we'll ever be a big booming town again.
Mae###those guys last night were like
Mae###deluded.
Mae###but it'd be really nice.
Mae###if there was a god
Mae###i might ask.
Mae###but i think they'd have to fight the other gods
Mae###that bled this place nearly to death.
Mae###i'm like
Mae###proud of us all
Mae###for having good-ass lives
Mae###in a shitty, stupid, good-ass town.
Mae###here's to you, Possum Springs.
Mae###here's to survival.
Mae###Hey look, some brochures!
Mae###Excuse me, but where is everybody?
Janitor###It's 10:45. It's closed.
Janitor###Not a lot of folks getting off the last bus to Possum Springs these days.
Janitor###Just you.
Not Stated###Isn't there supposed to be someone at the desk?
Not Stated###So are you the Janitor or something?
Mae###How's that door coming? -_-
Janitor###How's that soda coming?
Mae###One Freeasscola.
Janitor###Yummers.
Janitor###So what are you doing here?
Mae###I live here.
Mae###Well, lived here.
Janitor###Huh. Strange.
Mae###When do you think that door's gonna be finished?
Janitor###Now.
Janitor###Goodbye.
Mae###uh. bye.
Janitor###Closed.
Mae###Why are the lights on? Why is the TV on?
Janitor###I get spooked when I'm here by my lonesome.
Mae###Oh.
Janitor###Looks that way.
Mae###What do you do?
Janitor###I fix this door.
Mae###That's it?
Janitor###Nope.
Mae###Can I squeeze past you?
Janitor###Nope. Just broke the damn thing.
Mae###When do you think it might be done?
Janitor###Right after you go grab me a Fiascola from the machine.
Mae###...
Mae###Am I paying for this?
Janitor###I always rig it when I'm here after hours.
Mae###Nice. Free as in free? :)
Janitor###Free as in no one's here to say otherwise.
Mae###It's the ticket stand.
TV###Welcome back to Garbo And Malloy!
TV###What's in the news today, Malloy?
TV###Markets were up today!
TV###Waaaaaay up!
TV###I'm looking at a chart and it's pretty impressive!
TV###The economy added 15,000 jobs
TV###mostly in the chart sector
TV###which is notoriously recession proof!
TV###My my, Garbo, we got a little political there!
TV###Gotta get political every now and then.
TV###I went on one of those internet dates last week.
TV###Oh?
TV###Yeah the internet is a truly giving lover.
TV###Hey, any lovely ladies out there looking for an eligible bachelor?
TV###Get in touch!
TV###And I'll let you know if I find one!
Mae###What the?
Mae###They have Lime Fiasco and he wants a Fiascola?
Mae###That's just a waste.
Mae###Okay, just gotta grab it.
Mae###:) -_- Fiasco Fox you are too dreamy.
Mae###Wow. When did they put this up?
Mae###Possum Springs has never looked more...
Mae###...falsely advertised. :\
Mae###Visitors are going to be so let down when they see the actual town.
Mae###Prepare to be disappointed, ye who enter here!
Mae###Our Town Motto.
Mae###State forest up top,
Mae###Regular forest everywhere else.
Mae###Woods, woods, woods.
Mae###Look at that minecart.
Mae###That's all long gone.
Mae###Was this made by a time traveler?
Mae###It must be such a relief to payphone companies that Possum Springs gets zero cell reception.
Mae###It'd be cool to call my parents
Mae###but some jerkhole took the time to actually rip it off.
Mae###Who steals a phone?
Mae###I wonder what they're doing with that phone.
Mae###Sleeping with it at night.
Mae###Taking it for walks.
Mae###Holding it tight.
Mae###Talking into it
Mae###to nobody.
Mae###Smooching it so right.
Mae###Well, this is great.
Mae###I mean I didn't expect a party or anything
Mae###but I figured *someone* would be here.
Mae###...
Mae###Welcome home, Mae.
Mae###Well I'm right outside town.
Mae###Mom and dad nowhere to be found.
Mae###Dark and cold.
Mae###Guess I'm walking.
Mae###Alone.
Mae###Wow.
Mae###I didn't realize how much I missed the sound of that train.
Mae###I used to hear it in my bed at night
Mae###during the winter when the leaves were down.
Mae###This bus station is maybe the newest thing in Possum Springs.
Mae###Guess they got state funding or something.
Mae###It makes a good first or last impression I suppose
Mae###if not for the abandoned glass factory back there.
Mae###Not getting rid of that anytime soon.
Mae###Well, I guess I'm gonna hike through the woods.
Mae###Through the woods is home,
Mae###my bed,
Mae###and my negligent parents.
Mae###I'm not walking back out to the highway.
Mae###Probably get hit by a car or something.
Mae###Hey where did that Janitor go?
Mae###Did he walk?
Mae###Sorry about that.
Gregg###Ha ha that was kinda awesome.
Mae###Well I'm glad you didn't get killed.

Mae###I dropped out of school.
Chazokov###Oh.

Mae###Hey Mr. Chazokov
Chazokov###Did you jump down from the next door roof?
Varney###I'm going to call the cops next time, Mae!
Mae###Whatevs.
Varney###What?
Chazokov###I am like you, Mae. I am up here where a bear does not belong.
Mae###Are you using a telescope to... uh...
Mae###stare at the sun?
Chazokov###No no no!
Chazokov###I am calibrating for tonight, for something [color=dddddd][wave]amazing[/all]!
Mae###_o_
Mae###<o>
Mae###So what is this amazing thing?
Chazokov###Castys will appear in the western sky!
Mae###Who's Castys?
Mae###What's Castys?
Chazokov###Castys is a dusk star- a faint and wandering celestial object.
Chazokov###The star tells the story of woman who built a tower to heaven
Chazokov###And for this the gods sunk her deep into the sea.
Mae###Wow. Jerks.
Chazokov###But even in the depths, she refused to die.
Mae###:)
Mae###DAMN STRAIGHT.
Mae###:| _o_
Chazokov###What do you think the story means?
Not Stated###It means do awesome stuff and never die.
Not Stated###It means screw the gods, they are total jerks.
Chazokov###The gods are only stand-ins for things we cannot easily control.
Chazokov###We might just say floods, or cancer, or what have you.
Mae###Well, all of those things are jerks too. =_=
Chazokov###You'll have no argument from me.
Chazokov###But we can't control the stars either
Chazokov###and they are bigger and brighter than we are.
Mae###I might come back and check out your telescope sometime. o_o
Chazokov###My roof is your roof!
Chazokov###Ho ho ho!
Chazokov###If only it were that easy.
Chazokov###Think of Mr. Applebaum.
Mae###The statue guy?
Chazokov###His statue stands, but he and his mine are gone.
Mae###Well, I'm going to live forever. :)
Chazokov###I know you will, Mae.
Mae###I'm an effing Dracula. \o/
Chazokov###Oh no!
Mae###:| _o_
Mae###<o>
Mae###Are you an astrologer or something?
Chazokov###The word is [wave]astronomer[/wave], and I am but an amateur.
Mae###You know a lot for someone who isn't paid to know about it.
Chazokov###That is one of the saddest sentences I've ever heard.
Mae###_o_
Mae###Sorry?
Chazokov###Come back some evening, we'll cram some stars into that head of yours.
Mae###:)
Mae###Will do!
Mae###:|
Chazokov###My roof is your roof!
Mae###That was pretty great.
Chazokov###We can look again in two days time.
Chazokov###Will you be back?
None###Yeah if I remember!
None###Probably not.
Chazokov###Oh, you will be.
Chazokov###No one can resist the stars forever.
Mae###That’s spooky, Mr. Chazokov.
Chazokov###Beh heh heh hehe.
Chazokov###Mae Borowski! You could have knocked on the door down there.
Chazokov###Impolite to be on other people’s roofs!
Varney###Next time I’m gonna call the cops!
Mae###Whatever.
Chazokov###Beh heh heh heh!
Chazokov###At any rate, I am glad you have accepted my invitation!
Mae###What are you doing anyway?
Chazokov###Hunting dusk stars!
None###What’s dusk stars?
Chazokov###Wandering stars the light of which does not come through at night.
Mae###How does that work?
Chazokov###It is a trick of the atmosphere and setting sunlight.
Chazokov###Only visible for few weeks every year in the spring and fall, so lovely.
Mae###Neato.
None###Dusk Stars is the name of my shoegaze band.
Chazokov###Really?
Mae###No.
Chazokov###It is music of looking at shoes?
Mae###With a lot of reverb.
Chazokov###Why are we talking about shoes?
Mae###I forget.
Chazokov###Want to have a look?
None###Yeah!
Chazokov###Excellent!!!
None###Maybe later.
Chazokov###Suit yourself. I’ll be up here all afternoon.
Mae###See ya!
Mae###Wow. That was pretty great.
Chazokov###Come by again!
Chazokov###couple days!
Chazokov###we shall hunt the stars!
Chazokov###BEH HEH HEH!
Chazokov###Mae Borowski!
Mae###Yep!
Chazokov###Up here on my roof!
Mae###Yep!
Chazokov###Come to hunt some dusk stars?
None###Definitely!
Chazokov###Come have a look!
None###No thanks!
Chazokov###Suit yourself!
Mae###Wow. That was pretty great.
Chazokov###Yes it was! More in a couple days?
Chazokov###Ms. Mae Borowski!
Mae###Present!
Chazokov###MMM! Smell the autumn winds!
Mae###yeah. hard to miss it.
Chazokov###one should not miss such a thing.
Chazokov###talking of,
Chazokov###Want to see some stars?
None###Yeah!
Chazokov###Come have a look!
None###No thanks
Chazokov###Suit yourself!
Chazokov###Mae!
Mae###Mr. Chazokov!
Chazokov###you look at bit worse for wear today, Mae.
Mae###oh, I'm fine.
Mae###i made it up here, didn't i?
Chazokov###watch yourself, lest you fall!
Mae###will do.
Chazokov###Here to see some stars?
None###You know it!
Chazokov###Come have a look!
None###No thanks
Chazokov###Suit yourself!
Mae###Pretty sweet. The stars, I mean.
Chazokov###I am in agreement
Mae###So uh
Mae###are those star stories supposed to have morals or something?
Chazokov###I think you have to figure that out for yourself, Mae.
Mae###If it only means something because I want it to
Mae###then it doesn’t really mean anything, right?
Chazokov###...
Mae###What?
Chazokov###I have to think about that one for a bit.
Chazokov###Change your mind?
None###Yeah... I mean... stars are cool.
Chazokov###That thought has been the basis of my entire career.
Chazokov###Have a look!
None###No, just looking at your telescope.
Chazokov###She’s a beauty!
Chazokov###Hey Mae.
Mae###Hey Mr. Chazokov!
Chazokov###you back from college?
Mae###dropped out.
Chazokov###oh.
Mae###yeah.
Chazokov###you know I watch you run by so often
Chazokov###and yet
Chazokov###this is the first we've spoken since you've been home.
Mae###That's odd.
Mae###are you up here all the time?
Chazokov###rather often. It's a great vantage point!
Chazokov###you should stop by sometime! see the universe!
Mae###sounds like a plan, Mr. Chazokov.
Chazokov###you take care, mae!
Mae###Got any more dusk stars we can look at?
Chazokov###one more!
Mae###so what now?
Chazokov###Super moon is coming!
Mae###what is that?
Chazokov###A GIANT MOON!!!!!
Mae###ooooooh that does sound super.
Chazokov###you must come meet me when it happens
Chazokov###it will be late at night
Chazokov###there will be others on their roofs
Chazokov###you come, i will make the hot chocolate
Chazokov###WHAT A TIME!!!!
Mae###that sounds great!!!
Mae###I want to see a super moon!!!
Chazokov###PLAN ON IT!
Mae###see you later, Mr. Chazokov.
Chazokov###See you soon, stargazer.
Mae###<o>
Mae###Are you an astrologer or something?
Chazokov###The word is [wave]astronomer[/wave], and I am but an amateur.
Mae###You know a lot for someone who isn't paid to know about it.
Chazokov###That is one of the saddest sentences I've ever heard.
Mae###_o_
Mae###Sorry?
Chazokov###Come back in a couple days, we'll cram some stars into that head of yours.
Mae###:)
Mae###Will do!
Mae###:|
Mae###so how many stars are there?
Chazokov###...
Mae###what?
Mae###i mean the ones we're looking for!
Chazokov###should be a few left. but who can say?
Chazokov###we can only point our telescopes and look.
Chazokov###Well!
Mae###well.
Chazokov###The stars!
Mae###yep.
Chazokov###mae you should go home and get in bed
Mae###nah.
Chazokov###at least come down through the house

Mae###i'm good.
Chazokov###i will watch you go
Chazokov###and call the ambulance if needed.
Mae###thanks. that's really nice.
Chazokov###least i can do!
Mae###I give up. :( \o/
Chazokov###You give up too easily, Mae Borowski!
Mae###:| _o_
Mae###Argggh! I'll never figure this out. :( \o/
Chazokov###That's the attitude!
Mae###:| _o_
Mae###Blah. :( \o/
Chazokov###Maybe the stars are not for everyone...
Mae###:| _o_
Mae###Urghhh. :( \o/
Chazokov###I'm disappointed in you, Mae.
Mae###:| _o_
Mae###Oh huh. Looks like Mom's gone for the day.
Mae###Well geez.
Mae###Glad I don't need to do any churchy stuff.
Mae###Huh.
Mae###Door's locked.
Mae###What if I needed,
Mae###like,
Mae###Sanctuary from vampires or something.

Mae###something on the ground, drawn with ash...
Mae###-_-
Mae###
Mae###o>
Mae###huh.

Mae###Could be teens praying to whatever god teens pray to now
Mae###Could be...
Mae###-_-
Mae###hmmm.

Mae###Saint Rubio.
Mae###I think this guy breathed fire and ate people or something.
Mae###And now he's a statue.
Mae###In Possum Springs.
Mae###Because life is weird sometimes.

Dan###that pays money you don’t need for rent.
Mae###Alright, I’m gonna get going.
Dan###Yeah.
Dan###Construction's always hiring, Rob!
Dan###Well, at least the coffee shop is still open.
Dan###Even if it's not hiring.
Dan###Well there’s always a chance someone will die
Dan###And I can have their job.
Mae###Dan, you’re not gonna like
Mae###kill anyone, are you?
Dan###Does it pay?
Dan###I’ve been out of work for a year before.

Gregg###Same, dude.
Mae###So how have things been?
Gregg###Uh... good!
Mae###Weird seeing you with a regular job
Mae###that you like
Mae###go to.
Gregg###Yeah, working on the plan.
None###The plan?
None###Yeah I got plans too.
Gregg###Like what?
Mae###Washing this glue smell off.
Mae###What plan were you talking about?
Gregg###Bright Harbor.
Mae###Bright... harbor?
Gregg###Yeah. We're gonna move to Bright Harbor?
None###When?
None###Since when?
Gregg###Uh... a year or so now?
Gregg###That's why we're working like 7 days a week.
Mae###But... when are you moving?
Gregg###I think in the spring?
Mae###That's like... a few months away.
Gregg###Yeah!
Mae###Oh.
Gregg###You should come visit when we get settled in!
None###Why Bright Harbor?
None###Isn't Bright Harbor like really expensive?
Gregg###Not if you live in a terrible neighborhood!
Gregg###Oh Mae it's SO cool.
Gregg###We visited in the summer
Gregg###There's like record stores and weird bars
Gregg###and everyone's cool and like... free?
Mae###Oh.
Gregg###That's where I got my tattoo!
Mae###What?
Gregg###Yeah!
Gregg###
Mae###Is that a... sheep?
Gregg###Yep.
Mae###Why a sheep?
Gregg###...
Gregg###The tattoo guy was like all the way hot.
Gregg###And it didn't even hurt!
Mae###You have a tattoo.
Mae###You're moving to Bright Harbor.
Gregg###Yeah!
Mae###Oh.
Gregg###What's wrong?
Mae###Nothing!
Gregg###How long do you think you're staying in town?
None###Um. I don't know.
Gregg###I'll help you pick somewhere out.
None###Not long. Gonna move too.
Gregg###Ooh where to?
None###North.
Gregg###Cold and blizzards and hot cocoa!
Gregg###Ooh we can come visit in the summer!
None###South.
Gregg###Heat and tornadoes and sweet tea!
Gregg###Ooh we can come visit in the winter!
Mae###Yeah.
Gregg###It was really great hanging with you tonight.
Gregg###I've been really boring lately.
Gregg###Haven't done a crime in... a long time.
Mae###Why?
Gregg###Angus. The plan. Can't go to Bright Harbor if I get caught or fired.
Mae###You're all adult now.
Gregg###I'm bonafide.
Mae###I'm gonna go I think.
Gregg###Good call. We need to de-glue.
Mae###I think we stunk up the diner.
Gregg###Eh. Wouldn't be the first time.
Mae###=_= :)
Mae###I missed you.
Gregg###:)
Gregg###You too bro.
Mae###too bad you didn't snap your spine.
Gregg###too bad your arms didn't get ripped off.
Mae###too bad you weren't horribly disfigured.
Gregg###too bad you didn't fall and break your teeth on a stair.
Mae###too bad you didn't get trapped under the box
Gregg###too-
Mae###not finished
Mae###and then burned alive in a building fire.
Gregg###too bad you didn't crawl into a vent
Gregg###to escape the fire
Gregg###and get cooked.
Mae###aaah. good times.
Mae###I still smell gluuuuuuuuuuuuue.
Gregg###Think about something else.
Mae###I can't. I think I'm high from the glue.
Gregg###Think about pierogis.
Gregg###They have pierogis when you were at school?
Mae###This one church in town would sell them during whatever holiday.
Gregg###Feast Of The Perpetual Pierogi.
Mae###Yo dude.
Gregg###What?
Mae###Open your mouth.
Gregg###Why?
Mae###Trust me.
Gregg###True friendship is this.
Donna###10 minutes left.
Donna###Sorry for unloading on you like that.
Mae###Naw, it's cool.
Mae###Do you need a hug? /o\ :)
Donna###I'll pass.
Mae###_o_ :|
Mae###Hey! Donna, right?
Mae###You used to babysit me, remember?
Donna###Yep.
Mae###That's a sweet coat, Donna.
Donna###This is my nicest outfit.
Mae###Looks good! :)
Donna###I bought it at the Fort Lucenne Mall.
Donna###I only wear it to work.
Mae###I wear this outfit all the time.
Mae###It's my calling card.
Donna###I have nowhere else to wear this.
Not Stated###Well, enjoy your break!
Not Stated###My shirt is cool because it has multiple meanings.
Donna###See you around, Mae.
Mae###:|
Donna###I wear this outfit
Donna###to a job
Donna###where people can only hear my voice.
Mae###I made this shirt myself, too!
Donna###I'm 30 next week.
Mae###in home economics. I was really great at that.
Donna###I'm going to die in this town.
Donna###And they're going to bury me in this outfit.
Mae###I hope they bury me in this shirt. /o\
Donna###It's a very nice shirt, Mae.
Mae###Thanks!!!
Mae###:| _o_
Gregg###"Gnomeo"?
Mae###Professor Lucius Von Gnomeo.
Mae###He's a vampire and a scientist.
Mae###He invented a blood rocket.
Gregg###Wow, you gave him a backstory too.
Mae###Don't talk about the professor like he isn't here.
Gregg###...
Gregg###...I miss Mr. Gnome.
Gregg###Sigh.
Mae###I even gave him a name.
Mae###Professor Lucius Von Gnomeo. :)
Mae###:|
Gregg###Lucky for short.
Not Stated###Do you remember that one Witchdagger song about the well?
Not Stated###So you and Angus are really leaving?
Gregg###D:
Gregg###Yeah, the [shake=.1]DAH-DAH-DUUUUURGA[/shake] song?
Gregg###:|
Gregg###That song totally slays.
Mae###You know how the one verse is like
Mae###"[wave]Deep cold
Mae###darkest hole
Mae###in the center of everything[/wave]"?
Gregg###D:
Gregg###DAH-DAH-DUUUUURGA!!!
Gregg###:|
Mae###I used to think that song was just badass witch stuff.
Not Stated###But the other night I had a dream about it.
Not Stated###But now it just makes me sad.
Gregg###Mae, we gotta.
Gregg###I'm too much for this town to handle
Gregg###and Angus needs to be out of the sun as much as possible.
Mae###You know they have the sun in Bright Harbor, right?
Gregg###Mae, Bright Harbor has SO MANY Donut Wolfs.
Gregg###And punk shows.
Gregg###And people who aren't all straight gun nuts.
Not Stated###I think they have guns in Bright Harbor too.
Not Stated###You *HAVE* a gun! We shot your old tv with it!
Gregg###What kind of dream?
Mae###I was standing beside this well in the middle of some field.
Mae###And it was all rainy and foggy.
Gregg###Mmhmm?
Mae###And I kept trying to back away from it
Mae###but every time I moved I slipped in the mud and ended up closer to the well.
Gregg###Crap.
Mae###So I just had to stand still.
Mae###Not move at all.
Gregg###That sounds freaky, dude.
Mae###And the worst thing was
Mae###There was something deep down in the well.
Mae###Looking up at me.
Gregg###Thanks a lot dude, I'm totally gonna have nightmares now.
Gregg###That was a hunting rifle my dad gave me.
Gregg###That doesn't count.
Mae###What does your dad think about you leaving?
Gregg###I dunno.
Gregg###He's always too nice for me to know what he actually thinks.
Mae###Hey Gregg?
Gregg###Yeah?
Mae###I'm going to be really sad when you go, asshole.
Gregg###I know.
Gregg###Why?
Mae###I think about, like, a really deep hole :\
Mae###and not being able to get out.
Gregg###Are you afraid someone is going to throw you down a well?
Mae###No. :|
Gregg###Because I am totally gonna chuck your ass down a well.
Gregg###D:
Gregg###DAH-DAH-DUUUUURGA!!!
Gregg###:|
Gregg###Mae, in my uncle's living room there are 8 different guns within reach of the couch.
Mae###Wow, really?
Gregg###Yeah I think he's waiting for the FBI to come over the hill.
Mae###Coming for his 8 guns?
Gregg###He's our last line of defense.
Gregg###Hey remember that time in 9th grade when we made that bomb from off the internet?
Mae###The megaboom! You lost your eyebrows!
Gregg###A little more gasoline and I'd be wearing cool shades right now
Gregg###to cover the horrifying ruin of my charred, empty eye sockets.
Mae###Hey Gregg?
Gregg###Yeah?
Mae###I'm going to be really sad when you go, asshole.
Gregg###I know.
Mae###:(
Mae###I'm just... sad. And angry.
Gregg###Yeah for real, dude.
Mae###I come back home and everyone's already made other plans.
Mae###I just want to hold on to something
Mae###and like...
Mae###Everything is ending, but I want more.
Gregg###Mae, we can't stay here forever.
Mae###... :|
Mae###I know.
Gregg###How 'bout you, me and...
Mae###Professor Lucius Von Gnomeo.
Gregg###How 'bout you, me and the professor go break some lightbulbs behind the Snack Falcon?
Mae###Yes? Obviously?
Gregg###And Christine gave me a key for when I open,
Gregg###Which means all you can slurp slushies, on me!
Mae###These are the nights I'll remember when I'm 60.
Gregg###Also I stole a bunch of lighter fluid so we can set something pretty big on fire!
Mae###AWWOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Gregg###You know, Christine gave me a key for when I open.
Gregg###Which means free post-donut slushies!
Mae###I wish that gnome was still with us.
Gregg###Mae, some things you just have to let go.
Mae###...
Mae###Yeah.
Gregg###Come on, let's go steal from my boss, who trusted me.
Mae###These are the nights I'll remember when I'm 60.
Gregg###Also I stole a bunch of lighter fluid so we can set something pretty big on fire!
Mae###AWWOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Mae###=_= :(
Mae###ugh
Mae###it was all weird colored.
Gregg###puke usually isn't that color.
Angus###it was like
Angus###multiple colors.
Gregg###you ok, mae?
None###yeah. no. ugh.
None###i have a really weak stomach
Gregg###yeah you puke a... lot.
Mae###i get pukey at like
Mae###baby food
Mae###the inside of pumpkins
Mae###any beer
Mae###too much donuts
Gregg###i never puke.
Mae###my mouth tastes like broken dreams.
Mae###I am really mad at you two.
Gregg###why?
Mae###i hate awkward silences. o_o
Mae###am i like ruining your lives or something?
Mae###just tell me if i am instead of whatever this is.
None###do you not like me anymore, Angus?
Angus###what?
Angus###no, mae. i like you fine.
Mae###why are you being weird, then?
None###am i like making things weird, Gregg?
Gregg###no!
Angus###...
Gregg###kinda?
Angus###um. so,
Gregg###Angus. I'll take this.
Angus###thanks hon.
Gregg###Mae, remember my uncle?
Gregg###sheep farm out past Briddle? out by the interstate?
Mae###yeah. kinda. :|
Gregg###when i was like 8 my parents got sick of me
Gregg###and made me spend like a month there in the summer.
Gregg###and i spent the whole time following him around.
None###sheep are cool.
Mae###i had a stuffed sheep named Gordon.
None###sheep are nice.
Mae###i got to pet one once.
Gregg###sheep are real dumb is what they are.
Gregg###one afternoon before dinner my uncle left me by the pen
Gregg###and for some reason, i opened the gate.
None###why?
Gregg###i have no idea.
Gregg###kids are like sheep.
Gregg###real dumb.
Mae###they so are.
None###what did they do?
Gregg###so a bunch of the sheep basically immediately bolted
Gregg###and i chased after, being all
Gregg###YOU DUMBASS SHEEP!
Angus###you tried, bug.
Gregg###they ran across the field
Gregg###and into the woods
Gregg###and there was this really steep hill
Gregg###that went down to the interstate.
Mae###oh... oh no...
Mae###what happened?
Gregg###4 got splattered by a semi truck
Gregg###some ran back up the hill
Gregg###but three made it over the median
Gregg###and across to the other side.
Gregg###and they just... stopped.
Gregg###and i got to the bottom of the hill, by the road
Gregg###which was like covered in sheep guts and parts
Mae###*urp*
Gregg###and we just looked at each other across the interstate.
Gregg###me waving my hands
Gregg###two ran back, got hit by *another* truck
None###god.
None###did the trucks stop?
Gregg###THEY TOTALLY DIDN'T!
Mae###that's probably illegal.
Gregg###but the other one
Gregg###he ran down the hill on the other side
Gregg###into the woods.
Gregg###and no one ever saw him again.
Mae###geez, dude.
None###hey- your tattoo!
Gregg###yeah.
Mae###ha ha. I sleuthed the meaning.
None###what happened after that?
Gregg###i mean i ran back to the farm, crying.
Gregg###my uncle hit me a bunch.
Mae###no.
Gregg###yeah.
Gregg###there was some legal stuff
Gregg###and they moved away not long after.
Mae###that's awful for you.
Mae###poor sheep.
Gregg###but if i was in their position, i'd have run too
Gregg###and i want to be the one that got away.
Gregg###and i want angus to come with me.
Gregg###I like, failed those sheep.
Gregg###just like, you know... everything... has failed us.
Mae###that's a bit-
Gregg###no one even denies it.
Gregg###no one tries to talk you out of leaving here.
Gregg###and yeah, being the only queer people in town sucks.
Mae###i'm here!
Gregg###you already left once!
Mae###but i'm...
Mae###back.
Gregg###i can't stay. *WE* can't stay.
Mae###i guess.
Gregg###and I love Angus.
Angus###I love both of you.
Angus###obviously in different ways.
Mae###thanks for clarifying.
Gregg###we have a plan and we're working our asses off to make it happen.
Angus###two guys, full time, minimum wage.
Gregg###i have to grow up a bit.
Gregg###i *did* grow up a bit.
Gregg###Mae. You have to let me change.
Angus###sorry i was rude earlier.
Mae###it's ok.
Mae###remember the time we almost burned down the school?
Gregg###:)
Gregg###ha ha. yeah.
Mae###:)
Mae###fireworks. student council poster just *FWOOSH!*
Gregg###god. that was a good night.
Gregg###soaked from the sprinklers
Gregg###running through the parking lot
Gregg###laughing our asses off.
Mae###ha ha oh my god yeah.
Gregg###:|
Mae###:|
Mae###that was maybe the best night of my entire life.
Gregg###it's one of the all time greats.
Gregg###kids still talk about it.
Gregg###that night lives on, man.
Mae###well
Mae###we can at least be legends.
Gregg###forever.
Mae###:\
Mae###well, tonight was a complete bust.
Angus###i'm sorry.
Mae###:)
Mae###ha ha. stop apologizing, Angus.
Gregg###i'm sorry too.
Mae###it's cool.
Mae###and I have an idea.
Gregg###oh yeah?
Mae###you up for one more big crime?
Mae###you can come this time, Angus.
Mae###do a crime with us.
Angus###I...
Angus###ok.
Gregg###aw, cap'n. cap'n criminal.
Mae###let's go.
Mae###:)
Gregg###:)
Mae###too bad you didn't get partially eaten by a shark.
Gregg###too bad you didn't get serial killed.
Mae###too bad you didn't start doing drugs.
Mae###and then died from drugs.
Gregg###we tried weed a while back.
Mae###too bad you didn't O.D. and die from it.
Angus###ok are you two done?
Gregg###:|
Mae###FINALLY HERE!
Angus###yup.
Gregg###AW YEAH

DWCashier###yes ma'am.
Angus###Are we eating here?
Mae###I guess. Whatever.
Gregg###Um.
Gregg###Yeah, let's eat here!
Angus###Fine. I’m gonna go find a seat.
Mae###I have to go to the bathroom.
Gregg###...ok...
Gregg###this is fun.
Mae###So. :)
Mae###=_=
Mae###how you guys doing...?
Mae###anything new?
Mae###other than, you know
Mae###all this stuff that's been happening.
Mae###o_o :|
Mae###ghosts and stuff.
Mae###yep.
Mae###that's pretty new.
Mae###hey angus, how'd you get bea's car for tonight?
Angus###she was going to go to a party out of town
Angus###but i guess she lost her nerve.
Mae###oh.
Angus###and gregg and i were *supposed* to do something
Mae###this is something!
Angus###let's just eat.
Gregg###yes please let's eat.
Mae###woohoo! :)
Mae###So... got a gnome, a fishing pole, a badminton racket, and a fan.
Mae###Got two wheels and a... turny thing... with no wheel.
Mae###Probably just need to turn the turny thing...
None###...to open up the heat pipes.
Mae###Clanky’s probably got loads of heat but it can’t get out.
None###...to turn up the fire.
Mae###Clanky’s probably got a tiny fire going and could use some help.
Mae###We’ve all been there! Poor Clanky.
Mae###to get Clanky all hot and bothered.
Mae###We will teach Clanky to love.
Mae###I bet I could... hm...
Not Stated###I think Gnomey could bite onto the turny thing where the wheel was.
Not Stated###Could use racket as a handle.
Mae###Ok yeah. That’s the stuff.
Mae###Probably could like... pull him?
Not Stated###But we’re not always going to be here to pull him...
Not Stated###I think one good hard pull should be enough.
Mae###Yeah that would work.
Not Stated###Although we’re not always going to be here to pull it...
Not Stated###One good hard pull should do it.
Mae###The fan could stay on, and then if this breaks you only have to replace the fan...
Mae###It should be good for the environment too. That’s important.
Mae###Like the turbines on the mountain by Fort Lucenne.
Mae###God, I remember when everyone was so mad about that
Mae###“It’s gonna ruin the view! It’s gonna kill birds!”
Mae###You know what else is gonna ruin the view and birds?
Mae###When a meteor hits the earth because it gets too hot.
Mae###That’s what happened to the dinosaurs.
Mae###ok where was I?
Not Stated###Dinosaurs were effing rad.
Not Stated###Making a basement turbine out of a badminton racket.
Mae###ok, focus. work this out Mae Borowski.
Not Stated###I’m hungry.
Not Stated###I wonder what it’s like to get stuck in a cave.
Mae###The fan could stay on, and then if this breaks you only have to replace the fan...
Mae###It should be good for the environment too. That’s important.
Mae###Like the turbines on the mountain by Fort Lucenne.
Mae###God, I remember when everyone was so mad about that
Mae###“It’s gonna ruin the view! It’s gonna kill birds!”
Mae###You know what else is gonna ruin the view and birds?
Mae###When a meteor hits the earth because it gets too hot.
Mae###That’s what happened to the dinosaurs.
Mae###ok where was I?
Not Stated###Dinosaurs were effing rad.
Not Stated###Making a basement turbine out of a garden gnome.
Mae###They had dinosaurs in the ocean too!
Mae###I’m glad I wasn’t a fish back then.
Mae###Did they have fish? Were they like dinosaur fish?
Not Stated###No. Fish are fish, Mae. Get a grip.
Not Stated###I mean they’d have to be dinosaur fish, right?
Mae###Ok so... hm...
Mae###How much space do we have down here?
Not Stated###Looks like not much.
Not Stated###We got plenty of room.
Mae###So there isn’t a lot of wind down here, but like
Mae###Could put the fan on Gnomey’s butt
Mae###And that would make it spin...
Mae###Racket for the other fin part.
Mae###Tie it all together with the fishing line and WOW
Mae###I should, like, start a company
Mae###SUSTAINABLE GARBAGE TURBINE!!!
Bea###Ok done!
Mae###What?!
Mae###Right.
Mae###They had dinosaurs in the ocean too!
Mae###I’m glad I wasn’t a fish back then.
Mae###Did they have fish? Were they like dinosaur fish?
Not Stated###No. Fish are fish, Mae. Get a grip.
Not Stated###I mean they’d have to be dinosaur fish, right?
Mae###So there isn’t a lot of wind down here, but like
Mae###ok we stick Gnomey in the ground
Mae###sorry Gnomey
Mae###put the fan on top of his flat table-butt
Mae###I feel that pain, Gnomey. I have one too.
Mae###And tie the racket on like this...
Mae###Hey alright!
Mae###I should, like, start a company
Mae###SUSTAINABLE GARBAGE TURBINE!!!
Bea###Ok done!
Mae###What?!
Mae###Could go for some of that Wolf.
Mae###That D-D-Donut Wolf.
Mae###There’s that video online of their slammercake machine
Mae###watching it was how I fell asleep like half the nights at school.
Mae###Big complicated machine making delicious cake-ums.
Mae###I can’t imagine how anyone built something like that
Mae###Everything works perfectly but it’s so weird looking
Mae###Like someone was just making it up as they went along
Mae###and somehow created perfection.
Mae###I saw this thing on tv about people that scuba dive in caves.
Mae###Which, for my money, is really stupid.
Mae###Like in normal swimming you can drown
Mae###but you’re not in a cave, with horses and stuff.
Mae###"Horses?" I meant hoses.
Mae###Why am I thinking of horses?
Mae###OMG.
Mae###CAVE HORSES.
Mae###What if you were trapped by a cave horse?
Mae###I wonder how they’d pull you out?
Mae###Probably just have to wing it, make some big complicated thing
Mae###I can’t imagine there’s a machine made just for pulling scuba divers away from cave horses...
Mae###Although who knows what happens down there?
Mae###Aaaagh! Focus, Mae!
Mae###Maybe I should just wing this too? Just do it fast so I don’t overthink it?
Mae###OK LET’S DO IT!
Mae###ok tie the racket to the turny thing and then tie THAT to the fan but wait
Mae###how am i going to keep the fan from rolling up like a big fan fish
Mae###ok sorry gnomey i have to put you upside down like a vampire
Mae###i think they used to bury vampires upside down so when they tried to dig out
Mae###of their coffins they’d just dig down because ha ha ha ha stupid vampire
Mae###now you’re in the center of the earth and you died.
Mae###again.
Mae###Hey this looks great!
Mae###I’m like... an engineer!
Mae###Or whoever makes machines!
Mae###A machinegineer?
Mae###Alright let’s give this baby a go-
Bea###Ok done!
Mae###What?!
Mae###Right.
Mae###Fish were probably like aw man what the HELL.
Mae###“I can’t believe future fish don’t have to deal with this BS.”
Mae###“Sharks? Heh. Get a load of Piranha Nessie with rabies over here.”
Mae###Documentary guy is all like
Mae###“Millions of years ago the seas were full of Piranha Rabies Nessies.”
Mae###Ok FOCUS Mae.
Mae###Making a turbine.
Mae###Yeah, I mean back then they had dinosaur bugs, dinosaur trees, dinosaur poop.
Mae###I’d like to see a dinosaur moose. I bet that would’ve been pretty great.
Mae###Ok FOCUS Mae.
Mae###Making a turbine.
Mae###Fish were probably like aw man what the HELL.
Mae###“I can’t believe future fish don’t have to deal with this BS.”
Mae###“Sharks? Heh. Get a load of Piranha Nessie with rabies over here.”
Mae###Documentary guy is all like
Mae###“Millions of years ago the seas were full of Piranha Rabies Nessies.”
Mae###Ok FOCUS Mae.
Mae###Making a turbine.
Mae###Yeah, I mean back then they had dinosaur bugs, dinosaur trees, dinosaur poop.
Mae###I’d like to see a dinosaur moose. I bet that would’ve been pretty great.
Mae###Ok FOCUS Mae.
Mae###Making a turbine.
Mae###Ok so something compact.
Mae###Think Mae...
Not Stated###I wonder what Gregg’s up to?
Not Stated###What was the name of that one movie?
Mae###hm... focus, Mae.
Not Stated###I wonder if I’ll ever get that motorcycle.
Not Stated###I wonder what happened to Casey’s boat?
Mae###Oh wait, what’s gonna stop the fan from moving?
Mae###RACKET!!!
Mae###Alright well that looks perfect!
Mae###Got Gnomey as the handle,
Mae###the fan as the puller,
Mae###the line connecting them,
Mae###and the racket keeping the fan in place.
Mae###This is amazing!
Bea###Ok done!
Mae###What?!
Mae###Wonder if he figured out that thing...
Mae###I remember when Casey had that job at the BurgBear out by Briddle.
Mae###And he let us behind the counter to make whatever burgs we wanted
Mae###but then Jeff the manager came in and we had to jump out the drivethrough window
Mae###and Gregg’s leg got caught in some sort of cable
Not Stated###and a car almost ran over him
Not Stated###and he puked
Mae###The one where the guy got tied to that machine by that other guy.
Mae###And like totally got ripped in half?
Mae###That was pretty cool even if it looked faaaake.
Mae###I remember when he exploded there were like
Mae###twice as many bones as there should have been.
Not Stated###I wonder how that slipped past them?
Not Stated###Alright FOCUS Mae.
Mae###A cool bike that isn’t dumb and loud because that hurts my ears
Mae###Drag-racin’.
Mae###Can you drag race on bikes?
Mae###Or is that like a car thing?
Mae###That one old movie had the monster guy with the monster drag racer.
Mae###And he had a cool helmet and cool boots and it was the coolest thing ever.
Mae###Hm... could drag Gnomey...
Mae###Use the fan as like a wheel?
Mae###He had, like, a boat.
Mae###I think it was his dad’s before he died.
Mae###Lose a really shitty dad, get a boat!
Mae###During that flood the year granddad died, he rode it through the neighborhood
Mae###which was one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen.
Mae###but he almost hit that swimming dog with the propeller
Mae###life on the sea is dangerous
Mae###...hm... could use the fan as like a propeller... wheel... thing...
Mae###rev it up and let it yank Gnomey?
Mae###Tie gnomey to the racket, tie the racket to the fan...
Mae###Yeah Mae. That’s the stuff.
Mae###This is genius. I am a genius.
Mae###Alright let’s give this a shot-
Bea###Ok done!
Mae###What?!
Mae###but Jeff never caught us!
Mae###like, upside down
Mae###and he like... puked up his nose?
Mae###and then he puked again and it was like
Mae###perpetual puke for a few seconds
Mae###and I had to pull him out...
Mae###and we couldn’t stop laughing...
Mae###...could tie Gnomie to the to fan...
Mae###In honor of Gregg.
Mae###Maybe better movies have a bone supervisor
Mae###So things like this don’t happen.
Mae###Ok so let’s tie Gnomey to the fan...
Mae###With the fishing line

Mae###He's scum and a criminal and anyway I think he's been bad news from the start.
Gregg###Mm. Yes.
Mae###What deal did you make with him?
Gregg###He's allowed to shoplift whatever he wants from the Snack Falcon while I'm working.

None###That teacher sue you yet?
Mae###Or at least beat you up in a parking lot?
SteveScriggins###Which teacher?
Mae###The one you locked in the closet during Longest Night break.
SteveScriggins###Pssh. That guy can't even go in small rooms now.
SteveScriggins###He was always a wuss, just needed someone to bring it out.
Mae###... O_O

SteveScriggins###Your mom.
Mae###Great Steve.

SteveScriggins###Aw, he thinks it's cute.

Not Stated###Frog Head
Not Stated###Pig Head
Not Stated###Rabbit Head
Gregg###Ugh... which one?
Gregg###I'm bad at decisions that actually mean something.
Mae###You picked out the tuxes we wore to junior prom.
Gregg###Ok yeah... I'm pretty good at it.
Mae###Remember how Tim Whitley rode that giant tractor into homecoming?
Gregg###Totally.
Gregg###So... did you pick?
None###Dude gimme time.
Gregg###Ugh fine.
Mae###Dude, is this serious business?
Gregg###This is serious business.
Mae###Ok then let's treat it like serious business.
Gregg###I'm hungry though.
Mae###Uuuugh me too.
Gregg###We should eat later.
Mae###Yeah probably.
SteveScriggins###I DO HAVE places to be, you know!
None###I totally did.
Gregg###Oh cool

None###Nope!
None###Yep!
Gregg###YAY!
Gregg###
SteveScriggins###
Gregg###So this still works sometimes?
SteveScriggins###Eh.
SteveScriggins###You know Beth Holstead?
Gregg###Yeah.
SteveScriggins###She was in here like 6 months ago and she swears it talked.
Gregg###Whoa.
SteveScriggins###Didn't even have to push the button.
SteveScriggins###But I dunno how much stake I’d put in it.
SteveScriggins###You know Beth.
Gregg###Kinda?
SteveScriggins###There’s a lot of glue in here.
Gregg###I guess.
SteveScriggins###
SteveScriggins###GODDAMMIT!!!
Mae###What?
SteveScriggins###Someone locked the effin’ door!
SteveScriggins###Goddammit I bet it was Beth.
SteveScriggins###Or Levy.
SteveScriggins###Or the train trash.
Gregg###So...
SteveScriggins###AAAAAAAAAAAARGH
SteveScriggins###They better not have stolen anything.
Mae###...from the abandoned grocery store...
Mae###...with the unlocked doors…
Mae###What’s behind this door anyway?
SteveScriggins###Could probably bust it open...
Gregg###Or I could go get my lockpick stuff.
Mae###I bet there’s like a key or something.
SteveScriggins###Whatever.
Mae###What are you doing?
Gregg###Trying to find something to help bust down the door.
Mae###Cool. I’m looking for a key because I’m smarter.
Gregg###Uh huh. But I get to hit things.
Mae###...
Mae###crap.
Gregg###How much glue did they need in here?
Mae###Dude you gotta stick stuff to stuff to run a successful business.
Gregg###Well, apparently not.
Gregg###What are you doing?
Mae###Gonna check that office up there.
Gregg###Cool. Don’t like slice yourself to death on the glass.
Mae###Dumb death.
Gregg###Dumb death.
Mae###Yo idiots stop kicking before you break your femurs or something.
Gregg###I’m not an idiot.
Mae###Yeah sorry hey idiot and Gregg stop kicking.
Mae###I got keys.
SteveScriggins###Where’d you get them?
Mae###Office. Up there.
SteveScriggins###No wonder this place went under.
SteveScriggins###Leaving keys all over the place!
Mae###That was exactly what I thought.
Mae###I’m upset that we thought like the exact same words.
SteveScriggins###I thought it better.
Mae###
None###Why are we doing crimes with this guy?
Gregg###Robbers can’t be choosers.
Mae###They really can.
SteveScriggins###You know I can hear you, right?
None###Ugh. Why did it have to be Steve?
Gregg###He had an in.
Mae###What in?
SteveScriggins###I broke the front door.
Mae###:) \o/ [wave]My babies!!!
Mae###My little rat babies...
Mae###Well, not so little anymore.
Mae###You've made it! You've broken free!
Mae###U_U It's a [wave]miracle!

Mae###Alright stay just like that.
Gregg###OKAH.
Gregg###NOMNOMNOMNOMNOM
Gregg###I LAHVE AHNIAN.
Gregg###Pierogi waster!
Gregg###o god it burns!
Gregg###AAAH MY FACE
Mae###Out of pierogis!!!
Gregg###Dang.
Gregg###You know, a majority of those attempts hit me directly in the face.
Mae###Sorry about that.
Gregg###A majority of those made it into my mouth so I'm happy.
Mae###Alright!
Gregg###A lot of those ended up on the floor. I'm sad now.
Mae###Aw, sorry Gregg.
Mae###:) O_O
Mae###OH MY GOD.
Mae###The UREV is still here!
Bea###Ha ha yeah. This old thing.
Mae###I can feel the edginess from here.
Bea###Just looking in there makes me feel old.
Mae###We are so gonna do this.
Bea###There is no way I'm going in there.
Mae###
Mae###And yet Dollar Empire is still here?!
Bea###I think this is one thing the internet can't compete with.
None###I guess.
None###I used to go in here when I was a kid
Mae###You could get an eraser for a dollar, :)
Mae###a pencil for a dollar,
Bea###that actually doesn't sound like a good deal
Mae###Oh god you're right. :(
Bea###You up for eating?
Not Stated###Let's check out the rest of the mall first.
Not Stated###Yeah!
Mae###Work up an appetite.
Bea###I was kinda hungry when we got here...
Mae###Let's eat! \o/
Bea###Ok.
Mae###_o_
Mae###I expected more excitement.
Bea###Mall food court dinner.
Bea###Oh what a feeling.
Mae###See? That wasn't hard.
Bea###What did you get?
Bea###You inhaled it before I got a look.
None###Pizzataco from Go-fer
Bea###Go-fer is some GOOD garbage food.
Mae###Yeah I wish we'd get one in town.
Bea###Oooh that would be bad for me.
Mae###It'd be worth it.
None###Pierogiburger from Smelterburger
Bea###That's just a big pile of carbs and meat, huh?
Mae###Isn't that what WE are?
Bea###Bones too.
Mae###I don't want bones in my burger.
Bea###
Mae###What?
Bea###...
Mae###Remember when Cathy Daminco pulled out Cindy Clark's nosering here?
Bea###You know what that was about, right?
Mae###Wasn't Cathy pregnant with... what was his name... football guy...
Bea###Ron Boonstra. I didn't know you knew about that.
Mae###Well I mean there was the first football game of our senior year
Mae###and Ron ran up to the sideline and yelled at the stands
Mae###"MY FIRST TOUCHDOWN'S FOR MY BEAUTIFUL FIRSTBORN AND HIS MOMMY, CATHY DAMINCO"
Bea###That's... something.
Mae###Cathy was in marching band and she was crying I think.
Mae###And then he dumped her for Cindy a week later.
Bea###Oh yeah, see that's the part I know about.
Bea###That's what set off the whole nosering situation.
None###I wonder what Cathy's up to now?
Bea###Well, last year Ron had this ATV accident
Bea###and somehow Cathy and him got to talking after that
Bea###and... they got married!
Mae###Huh. :\
Bea###Yeah Ron's parents set them up out in a double wide out in Briddle
Bea###since Cathy refused to end up in Possum Springs.
Mae###Briddle's like... 15 minutes away.
None###I wonder what Ron's doing?
Bea###Uh, last year he flipped his ATV
Bea###and the medical bills were really high
Bea###so his parents basically had to bail him out.
Mae###Yeah that'll happen. :\
Bea###And he got talking to Cathy again and now they're married.
Bea###Worked out for Ron I guess.
None###I wonder what happened to Cindy?
Bea###I imagine she got a new nosering.
Bea###Or, conversely, never wanted a nosering ever again.
Bea###You know what the worst part of this story is?
None###The sordid highschool drama?
None###Cindy having something ripped out of her face?
None###Ron?
Bea###At the time I was like
Bea###"god moves things around in the strangest ways to bring two people together"
Mae###:|
None###Hm. I guess.
Bea###Well, it used to make things make more sense at least.
None###I don't know if I even believe in god.
Bea###Same, really.
Bea###Thinking about this place- the fountain and the god-walkway and stuff...
Bea###Not knowing how something worked used to seem like... magic.
Bea###Now not knowing means it might be going wrong and I may not be able to fix it.
Bea###Helped knowing someone was at the controls, you know?
Bea###Now I'm just tired all the time from the shop.
Mae###When I was at school...
Bea###Yeah?
Mae###Ah, don't even want to talk about it.
Bea###What happened, anyway?
Mae###...
Mae###You want to run around the mall some more?
Bea###Uh... there's not really much else to run around.
Mae###We can check out the weird bad art upstairs!
Mae###I wanna touch it.
Bea###Please don't.
Mae###I wanna run! :)
Bea###You run. I'm gonna sit here.
Bea###I'm tired. And sad now.
Mae###:|
Mae###Suit yourself.
Mae###BEATRICE SANTELLO!!!
Bea###Ha ha ha ha!!! Don't give them our names!
Mae###...
Mae###BEATRICE JONES!!!
Bea###Oh wow! Is that you, god?
Mae###YES! IT IS I, GOD STEVENSON
Bea###I didn't know you had a last name!
Mae###SILENCE, MORTAL
Mae###THROUGH MY FISH MONSTER I HAVE LAIN WASTE TO YOUR KIND
Bea###I'm not gonna lie- that was pretty magical.
Mae###SILENCE! I SHAN'T SAY IT AGAIN!
Mae###YOU AND YOUR GOOD AND NOBLE COMPANION SHALL GET ICE CREAM ON THE WAY HOME
Bea###HA HA HA yeah we should probably get out of here
Bea###HA HA HA HA before you're ARRESTED
Bea###AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
Mae###THE COPS SHALL BE CONFUSED AND STUFF AND BEAT EACH OTHER UP
Mae###FOR I AM GOD, AND I HATE THE COPS
Bea###Ok ok! Get down here!
Mae###HAVE A GOOD ONE, MORTAL
Mae###This place used to be something.
Bea###I mean, it's still *something*.
Mae###Nah. Just a big mostly-empty thing
Mae###in a big mostly-empty parking lot.
Bea###Well, you work with what you have.
Mae###Let's never come here again.
Bea###Don't have to convince me.
Bea###I only came here because you wanted to.
Mae###Well, Fort Lucenne used to be something
Mae###now Fort Lucenne's over.
Bea###Let's go.
Bea###Let it die in peace.
Mae###Let. It. Die.
Mae###I wanna drive on the way home.
Bea###Nope.
Mae###:)
Mae###FORT LUCEEEEEEEEEEENNE!!![/wave] \o/ -_-
Mae###O_O :(
Mae###Oh my god.
Bea###Yep.
Mae###_o_
Mae###What the hell happened?
Bea###Um... The Internet?
Mae###We had the internet when we used to come here!
Mae###WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CAROUSEL?!
Bea###Sold it I guess.
Mae###WHO BUYS A CAROUSEL?!
Bea###Nobody who comes here.
Mae###WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BOOKSTORE?!
Bea###Also the internet.
Mae###WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ARCADE?!
Bea###I'm going to make a sign that says "The Internet"
Bea###and hold it up until you're done asking.
Bea###:(
Bea###Why did I do that?
Mae###-_- :)
Mae###You did so well Bea!!!
Bea###I call the cops on shoplifters at my OWN STORE!
Bea###This...
Mae###o_o
None###What did you get?
Bea###Some kind of necklace thing?
Mae###nice, nice
Bea###Oh god.
None###Haven't you even shoplifted before?
Bea###No! Never!
Mae###Ok now you're making *me* feel weird about it.
Bea###...sorry?
Mae###Forget it. We're home free.
Bea###Really?
Mae###Yeah we're like out in open waters now.
Bea###I feel kinda sick.
Mae###Let's walk it off.
Bea###:|
Mae###:|
Mae###=_= :(
Bea###Mae Borowski. I do de-clare.
Bea###I thought you were like a master criminal or something
Mae###Shut up
Bea###because [wave]dinosaurs!!!
Mae###I'm rusty! Or she's like a superhuman.
Mae###Whatever.
Bea###Well you know. Can't be good at everything.
Bea###Gotta let some dreams go.
Mae###Aw yeah. Sweet belt buckle I am never, ever going to wear.
Mae###Rubs against my stomach.
Bea###This is bad, Mae.
Mae###o_o :|
Mae###You should steal something now!
Bea###Pardon?
Mae###Haven't you ever done like *ANY* crimes?
Bea###I mean yeah I guess. Hasn't everyone?
Mae###WELL GET BACK IN THERE, CHAMP! :)
Bea###What? No.
Mae###Beatrice, let me lay this out:
Mae###1. The security cameras aren't even on in there.
Mae###2. The cashier clearly isn't paying attention.
Bea###Seemed vigilant enough for you.
Mae###-_-
Mae###anyway
Mae###o_o
Mae###3. There is not one Mall Cop here as far as I can tell.
Bea###I dunno... I mean... hmmm
Mae###BEA. THIS IS AN EXPERIENCE.
Mae###HAVE IT.
Mae###I'll run interference!
Bea###Ok... but I'm blaming you and driving away if I get caught.
Mae###Perfect! \o/

Mae###wow. I completely forgot about this giant fish head.
Bea###oh my god. I loved her.
Mae###Did you ever come to the Summer Daze thing here?
Bea###Yeah it'd like squirt people. I still have no idea how they did that.
None###I always assumed it was some guy in there with a squirt gun.
Bea###No, it was totally a fountain they tricked out to squirt people.
Mae###That's amazing.
None###One time I saw it knock a guy down.
Bea###Yeah every year that would happen and someone would make a fuss.
Bea###But like. I dunno.
Bea###You showed up to be squirted by a fish fountain.
Bea###Heh heh. You know the walkway way up there
Bea###past the upper food court thing
Bea###up in the atrium?
Mae###The what?
Bea###The ceiling. The glass part that points up.
None###I know what an atrium is.
Bea###uh huh
Bea###anyway
None###yeah?
Bea###When I was a kid I thought that that's where god lived.
Mae###Wow.
Bea###I dunno. Just remember staring at it when I was a kid.
Bea###Like, eating a burger
Bea###and trying to see if I could see God
Bea###like peeking over or something.
Mae###Looks like they've got some weird hanging “art” up there now.
Mae###Wanna go up and see?
Bea###Nah, my knees are killing me from work.
Mae###“Space IV: The Rocks Cosmic”
Mae###“an installation by Rorford Gimms”
Mae###“sponsored by Dollar Empire”
Mae###“caution: do not stand on the art”
Mae###Wow. This sure is the lonely end of the mall.
Mae###Weird being in such a big place
Mae###Alone.
Mae###Huh. Thought there was more to this place.
Bea###Nope.
Mae###This isn’t even a mall. This is like a hallway with crap in it.
Mae###Wow. Look at that big dark empty parking lot.
Bea###Yeah. Not sure if it’s ever been filled.
Mae###There aren’t enough people in the whole town.
Bea###Probably not.
Mae###It’s like a big black ocean.
Bea###With a Fishtastic on the other side.
Mae###Oh shiiiiiiit.
Mae###I got a weird fever from eating at that Fishtastic.
Mae###What a mess.
Mae###I can't believe this place even has the lights on anymore.
FortuneTeller###Dare you spin the wheel of destiny?
Mae###Explain.
FortuneTeller###None can explain the power of the wheel
FortuneTeller###save that it is an unknowable circular sooth-sayer.
Mae###oh snap is it gonna say the sooth?
FortuneTeller###The sooth shall be said.
Mae###ok I'm into this.
FortuneTeller###A mighty spin! A commendable spin!
FortuneTeller###Spin, spin, spin away.

FortuneTeller###and yet there is something else you desire
FortuneTeller###and it shall ever elude you.
Mae###oh come on.

FortuneTeller###You fortune is your future
FortuneTeller###a place you will soon be

FortuneTeller###and times for standing your ground.
FortuneTeller###and you shall sometimes know only in hindsight.
Mae###that's it? that's not mystical!
Mae###that's just like... a fortune cookie
FortuneTeller###You fortune is your future
FortuneTeller###a place you will soon be
FortuneTeller###forever.
Mae###ok that checks out
FortuneTeller###your card says much...
FortuneTeller###some things you shall understand

Mae###that's a dumb fortune!
Mae###that's everyone! everyone is like that!
FortuneTeller###You fortune is your future
FortuneTeller###a place you will soon be

Mae###this isn't a fortune! this is just like regular life!
FortuneTeller###Oops, some kinda bug happened.
FortuneTeller###Make sure to let the developers know so they can fix it.
Mae###Okay!
FortuneTeller###the cards do not lie
FortuneTeller###the wheel that chooses the card is unknowable.
Mae###so this is... unknowable truth?
FortuneTeller###you have learned much, child.
Mae###I'm 20.
Mae###...well that was interesting.
FortuneTeller###May the wheel ever spin in your favor.
Mae###Alright then.
Mae###Wow this is heavier than I expected.
Gregg###Right??
Gregg###So make sure you pull back before you release the trigger.
Mae###then I just shoot wherever?
Gregg###not at me.
Mae###awright.
Gregg###Well, that's the ground.
Mae###Yeeeep.
Gregg###Still the ground.
Gregg###Dude. Like, aim up.
Gregg###Up up up!
Gregg###Dude you are going and grabbing all of those off the ground.
Gregg###By *ACCIDENT* you should have not hit the ground by now.
Gregg###It barely seems worth it to say anything.
Gregg###Alright. So.
Mae###Yeah.
Gregg###Wow you sure murdered that tree.
Mae###That tree had it coming.
Gregg###Nice.
Mae###Trees are my natural enemy.
Gregg###Tree.
Gregg###Ya treed it.

Mae###It’s *OLD* up here.
Bea###sure is.
Bea###maybe your... ghost? is up here.
Mae###o_o
Mae###yep. ghost.
Mae###or something.
Mae###whatever he was,
Mae###he walked through a chain link fence
Mae###or flew over it
Mae###or something.
Mae###*while* carrying something.
Bea###oh right, well that's even more impressive.
Mae###so we're gonna go find this guy.
Mae###because he took someone
Mae###and he's like somehow connected to this thing i've been going through
Mae###and that's not good.
Mae###:\
Mae###that all sounded a lot more bad-ass in my head.
Bea###it's ok. it was fine.
Mae###:|
Mae###so we’ve got some leads
Mae###can I borrow your car this week?
Bea###do you even have a license?
Bea###I mean no, regardless, but do you?
Mae###nope.
Mae###no license, no credit cards, don’t believe in money
Bea###you just believe in other people’s cars and money
Mae###i didn’t choose to be born into this society
Bea###...
Bea###ok well I have, you know, a job
Bea###so i can’t drive you around to all of these spots
Bea###i can maybe do the graveyard?
Bea###i need to go there anyway.
Mae###:)
Mae###cool! I’ll see if gregg wants to do the other two.
Bea###you know, like, and i probably don’t have to say this
Mae###:|
Bea###but just because something happened in the past
Bea###doesn’t mean it’s going to happen again.
Mae###o>
Mae###Hey nerd, ever hear that history repeats?
Mae###It does. It does the same thing over and over again.
Bea###So we’ve just been in a loop since we were living in caves?
Mae###_o_
Mae###Yeah. That’s science.
Bea###oh my freaking god.
MissQuelcy###Ahem!
Mae###What is...
Bea###Is that Miss Quelcy?
Mae###oh wow. Haven’t seen her since graduation.
Bea###she was always kind of a badass.
Bea###school district did not fund that art program at all.
Bea###but she made it work
Bea###she was like some sort of art teacher survivalist.
Mae###wow. I never realized.
Bea###I think they pay her in bits of string and empty soda cans.
Mae###Should be saving that string to repair those bridges into Saltztown.
Bea###There you go.
MissQuelcy###Thank you all for coming to this second meeting
MissQuelcy###Of the Possum Springs Poetry Society
Bea###Do you want to stick around for this?
None###Naw.
Mae###:\
Mae###public poetry performance should probably be outlawed.
Bea###when have you ever seen one?
Mae###school. old roommate.
Bea###you’ve never mentioned your old roommate.
Mae###she’s an entire story unto herself.
Mae###:|
MissQuelcy###Excuse me, are you two staying?
MissQuelcy###if so, would you like to have your conversation up here?
Mae###No! To both!
Mae###We’re not big into rhyming everything we say.
MissQuelcy###Poetry doesn’t have to rhyme!
Mae###That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard.
None###Yeah!
MissQuelcy###Tonight we have new poems from myself
MissQuelcy###and "Fisherman" Jones
MissQuelcy###and Selma Ann Forrester.
MissQuelcy###I will start us off with one of my own.
None###she's from some big city, right?
Bea###yeah
Mae###how'd she end up here?
Bea###who knows.
None###they don't actually pay her in string, right?
Bea###...
Bea###Yes, Mae. They literally pay her in string.
Mae###I was just joking!
Bea###right.
MissQuelcy###*ahem*

Fisherman###so it hardly is your place to judge.
Fisherman###...
Fisherman###ok that's one poem. the next one is shorter.

Fisherman###...
Fisherman###that's it.
MissQuelcy###That's great! Thank you "Fisherman" Jones!

Mae###...and then she jumped--
Granddad###No Mae. Just stop.
Granddad###Sigh.
Adina###...hello?
Adina###Are you there?
ForestGod###You've come late.
ForestGod###You are no Empress.
ForestGod###Centuries have passed since I spoke to one so small and unimportant.
ForestGod###It is my right to kill you.
Adina###I didn't know that.
ForestGod###Accept it. Death is happening always.
Adina###Why should I accept it?
ForestGod###It is the natural way.
Adina###Funny how you decided that the way that allows you to kill me
Adina###is the natural one.
ForestGod###Brrrrrrrrrrrrrl.
Adina###You're not a god.
Adina###You're just a big animal.
ForestGod###They call me a god.
ForestGod###So I'm god enough.
ForestGod###Tell me what was so important to say to me that you would give up your life.
Not Stated###I know why you are dying.
Not Stated###I know why you are sick.
GodtenderBrown###Approach them with humility.
GodtenderBrown###I will wait here.
ForestGod###BRRRRRRRRRL.
ForestGod###Sickness cannot touch me.
Adina###You don't have a sickness, but you are dying.
Adina###Funny, now that it's happening to you, death isn't so easy to accept, huh?
ForestGod###It was Godtender Brown who told you I was weak.
ForestGod###Useless, worthless.
ForestGod###I will find use for him. He will feed the forest.
ForestGod###The trees will find worth in him.
Adina###No.
Adina###Godtender Brown is a good man.
Adina###He is kind and curious and warm.
Adina###Even while standing out in the cold, for you.
ForestGod###BRRRRRRRRL.
Adina###He thinks he doesn't deserve you
Adina###But you don't deserve him.
Adina###And I'd rather you die never knowing what happened to you
Adina###then to have you touch one hair on his head
Adina###or betray his devotion.
ForestGod###Why are we sick?
Adina###Promise Brown will be safe. Promise on whatever is holy to you.
ForestGod###I promise on myself. I promise on the 10 million mile forest.
Adina###Good.
ForestGod###Now swear on what is holy to you.
Not Stated###I swear on the stars.
Not Stated###I swear on the family you find.
Not Stated###I swear on the search.
ForestGod###BRRRRRRRRRL.
ForestGod###I am not dying.
Adina###Oh, I thought you might have accepted it.
Adina###Death being always and all that.
ForestGod###It was Godtender Brown who told you.
ForestGod###Useless, worthless.
ForestGod###I will find use for him. He will feed the forest.
ForestGod###The trees will find worth in him.
Adina###No.
Adina###Godtender Brown is a good man.
Adina###He is kind and curious and warm.
Adina###Even while standing out in the cold, for you.
ForestGod###BRRRRRRRRL.
Adina###He thinks he doesn't deserve you
Adina###But you don't deserve him.
Adina###And I'd rather you die never knowing what happened to you
Adina###then to have you touch one hair on his head
Adina###or betray his devotion.
ForestGod###Why are we dying?
Adina###Promise Brown will be safe. Promise on whatever is holy to you.
ForestGod###I promise on myself. I promise on the taiga, endless.
Adina###Good.
ForestGod###Now swear on what is holy to you.
Not Stated###I swear on the stars.
Not Stated###I swear on the family you find.
Not Stated###I swear on the search.
ForestGod###If that is what gives you hope, fine.
ForestGod###Now speak.
Adina###The only reason I came here is because of Godtender Brown's sadness
Adina###and his love for you.
Adina###But you won't survive. And now I want you to know that.
ForestGod###SPEAK!!!!!
Adina###The Huncher poisoned you.
Adina###Obviously.
ForestGod###BRRRRRRRRRRRRRL.
ForestGod###There was peace! After-
Adina###hundreds of years, I know.
ForestGod###But why?
Adina###She's a survivor.
Adina###It appears you won't be.
ForestGod###Then neither shall she.
Adina###Ugh.
Adina###You big dumb animal.
ForestGod###BRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARLLLLL!!!!!
Adina###Goodbye.
Adina###They're gone.
GodtenderBrown###They'll be back! They always are.
Adina###Godtender...
GodtenderBrown###Yes, Empress?
Adina###You're a good man.
GodtenderBrown###Thank you, I can only hope to be good.
Adina###Hope is good. Whatever happens, please don't lose that.
GodtenderBrown###I wish you blessings on your journey.
Adina###You as well. Happy Longest Night.
GodtenderBrown###Happy Longest Night to you.
Mae###I'm getting sleepy, Granddad.
Granddad###We're almost done, Mae.
Mae###Ok good. I like the story a lot.
Granddad###I knew you would.
Mae###You can rob banks with me anytime.
Mae###...and then she jumped off the cliff!
Granddad###What? No she didn't!
Mae###...and then she jumped off the cliff AGAIN!
Granddad###No she DIDN'T.
Mae###...and then she jumped!!
Granddad###You see, this is why I read you Charity Bearity.
Mae###Jump!!
Granddad###*ahem*
Granddad###"Charity Bearity Learns To Shareity"
Mae###Jumpa-jumpa-jump!!
Granddad###"In the town of Careity, there lived a little bear
Granddad###named Charity Bearity."
Mae###Juuuuuump!
Granddad###"Charity Bearity never liked to share her toys."
Mae###Oh no she jumped again!
Granddad###"She wouldn't share them with the girls, she wouldn't share them with the boys."
Mae###She jumped because she hates Charity Bearity!
Granddad###Ugh, gonna skip ahead a few pages...
Granddad###"No, she cried, I like not sharing just fine!"
Granddad###"To force me to share is to say they're not mine!"
Mae###She jumped because she saw a bear she could land on!
Granddad###Was it Charity Bearity?
Mae###Yeah! She squashed her flat!
Mae###Jumpjumpjump!
Granddad###"...and that's how Charity Bearity learned to share"
Granddad###"...ity."
Granddad###Ugh.
Mae###Juuuuuuuuuuump!
Granddad###This can't even be fun anymore. Aren't you getting tired!
Mae###I hate Charity Bearity!
Granddad###This story isn't even about Charity Bearity!
Mae###Then she ju-
Granddad###No. No she didn't.
Granddad###She never jumped.
Granddad###Do you want to hear this story or not?
Mae###...yes...
Granddad###I promise you'll like it.
Mae###*yawn* Ok.
GodtenderBrown###Hello?
GodtenderBrown###Wait!
Adina###Yes?
GodtenderBrown###I'm truly sorry, but you cannot see the Forest God this Longest Night.
Adina###Why not? I-
Adina###uh... we...
Adina###have already come so far for an audience!
GodtenderBrown###The truth is, and you must keep this a secret, but...
GodtenderBrown###but...
GodtenderBrown###The Forest God is sick. They are old and dying.
GodtenderBrown###And they cannot see you. It might upset them and we can't risk that.
Not Stated###Sick?
Not Stated###Dying?
GodtenderBrown###This is the worst Longest Night ever.
Adina###Hm... need to find something special for this face...
Adina###...probably more in the woods, I'd reckon...

Not Stated###Yes, and Clancy is excellent at his job.
Adina###Uh oh.
Adina###We didn't anticipate that you would have this combination of snowmen.
Adina###So... uh... sorry about that?
Snowdog###*ARF!*
Adina###Hello there.
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###Aw, you're a dog!
Snowdog###*woof!*

Snowthief###Well, that went ok.
Snowthief###We doing this?
Adina###Hello there.
Snowthief###Ugh. What do you want?
Adina###Sorry to bother you, but I need your help.
Snowthief###Oh crap. I died, didn't I?
Snowthief###This is so typical.
Adina###Listen, by me bringing you here
Adina###I think you'll be able to get out of these woods
Adina###and do whatever dead people do.
Snowthief###Is that something I want?
Adina###I have no idea.
Snowthief###Ok, whatever.
Adina###Follow my lead.
Snowblow###*HONK!*
Adina###Hello there.
Snowblow###*HONK!*
Adina###Ok wow, are you just a horn?
Snowblow###*HOOOOOONK!*
Adina###Let's try this- honk once for yes and twice for no. Got it?
Snowblow###*HONK!*
Adina###Are you just a horn ghost kind of thing?
Snowblow###*HONK! HONK!*
Adina###Are you the person who played this horn?
Snowblow###*HONK!*
Adina###Listen, by bringing you back
Adina###I think you'll be able to get out of these woods
Adina###and do whatever dead people do.
Adina###Does that sound ok?
Snowblow###*HOOOOOONK!*
Adina###Ok, great! Follow my lead.
Snowdrunk###I can't believe I've been sober the entire time I've been dead.
Snowdrunk###Let's do this. I'm not getting any less dead.
Adina###Hello there.
Snowdrunk###...hello?
Adina###Sorry to be abrupt, but I need your help.
Snowdrunk###Wait, where am I?
Adina###You're on the Forest God's mountain.
Snowdunk###Oh! Are we going to see the Forest God?
Snowdrunk###Because I'm going to the Frozen Lake.
Adina###So am I!
Adina###You're not.
Snowdrunk###Oh!
Snowdrunk###...oh.
Adina###Listen, by my bringing you here
Adina###I think you'll be able to get out of these woods
Adina###and do whatever dead people do.
Snowdrunk###Ok, that sounds as likely as anything else that's happening.
Adina###Ok, follow my lead.
GodtenderBrown###Oh Empress, the Forest God is still ill.
Adina###I'm so sorry.
GodtenderBrown###If only I just knew why, and whether they would be well again.
GodtenderBrown###I thank you for leaving your companions with me, as they have been a great comfort.
Adina###No problem. I entrust them to your care.
Adina###Godtender Brown!
GodtenderBrown###Empress! It's so late! Why are you still here?
Adina###Listen, this is very important.
Adina###I know why your god is dying.
GodtenderBrown###W-what?
Adina###You see, I saw-
GodtenderBrown###No, you must tell it to them.
Adina###What? Why?
GodtenderBrown###I'm not worthy of hearing of their weaknesses.
GodtenderBrown###I don't deserve the peace I have found here
GodtenderBrown###and I must honor them as best as my frail self will allow.
Adina###That's really something.
GodtenderBrown###Come with me. NOW!
GodtenderBrown###This is the worst Longest Night ever.
GodtenderBrown###Here's to better days.
Adina###How can a god be sick?
GodtenderBrown###I do not know.
GodtenderBrown###If only I knew what was happening!!!!
GodtenderBrown###We Godtenders are tasked with caring for the Forest God.
GodtenderBrown###But this sickness, we have never seen its like.
GodtenderBrown###Not in the 700 years of records kept since Saint Cecil began Tending God.
Adina###Oh no.
GodtenderBrown###We thought when the peace came, all would be well.
Adina###The peace?
GodtenderBrown###But centuries of conflict with her have weakened them.
GodtenderBrown###And not long after they became ill.
Adina###Her?
GodtenderBrown###DO NOT SAY HER NAME HERE.
GodtenderBrown###My heart is broken. My god is sick and old.
GodtenderBrown###I don't know what my life would be without them.
Adina###I'm sorry, Godtender.
GodtenderBrown###There is nothing you can do, Empress.
GodtenderBrown###As representative of the Forest Throne,
GodtenderBrown###I say that no power of the Forest God shall bar your way this Longest Night.
GodtenderBrown###As for [speed=.5][shake=.01]Her[/all], you are at the mercy
GodtenderBrown###of the most dangerous creature in the forest.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender Brown.
GodtenderBrown###Go, and take a blessing with you.
Adina###How can a god be dying?
GodtenderBrown###I do not pretend to know the ways of such things.
GodtenderBrown###If only I knew what was happening!!!!
GodtenderBrown###We Godtenders are tasked with caring for the Forest God.
GodtenderBrown###But this, this death, we have never seen its like.
GodtenderBrown###Not in the 700 years of records kept since Saint Cecil began Tending God.
Adina###Oh no.
GodtenderBrown###We thought when the peace came, all would be well.
Adina###The peace?
GodtenderBrown###But centuries of conflict with her have weakened them.
GodtenderBrown###And not long after they became ill.
Adina###Her?
GodtenderBrown###DO NOT SAY HER NAME HERE.
GodtenderBrown###My heart is broken. My god is dying.
GodtenderBrown###I don't know what my life would be without them.
Adina###I'm sorry, Godtender.
GodtenderBrown###There is nothing you can do, Empress.
GodtenderBrown###As representative of the Forest Throne,
GodtenderBrown###I say that no power of the Forest God shall bar your way this Longest Night.
GodtenderBrown###As for [shake=.01]Her[/shake], you are at the mercy
GodtenderBrown###of the most dangerous creature in the forest.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender Brown.
GodtenderBrown###Go, and take a blessing with you.
GodtenderBrown###SIGNS AND WONDERS!!!!
Adina###When Clancy was but a child
Adina###He longed to bring peace to the beasts of the field.
Snowdrunk###He sure did!
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###And he was blessed with the ability to speak to them.
GodtenderBrown###Why does he not speak to us?
Adina###um...
Snowdrunk###hm.
Not Stated###He has forgotten how, such is his dedication.
Not Stated###He is currently speaking to our Imperial Hound, Dart.
Snowdrunk###...
Adina###Williams???
Snowdrunk###Yes, this dog has a straight line through to heaven.
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###He was born with one ear that was white as the snow
Adina###and that's the ear he uses to hear the celestial realms.
GodtenderBrown###Amazing!
Snowdog###*arf!*
Snowdrunk###Yes, we are quite-
Snowdog###*arf!* *arf!*
Snowdrunk###-humbled in light of-
Snowdog###*arf!* *arf!* *woof!* *bark!* *woof!* *arf!* *woof!* *arf!* *bark!*
Snowdrunk###dear god either shut that dog up or send me back to death
GodtenderBrown###What's that?
Not Stated###Williams was just having an intuition!
Not Stated###Clancy is receiving a vision right this moment!
GodtenderBrown###Oh, you have a dog with you as well! I love dogs!
GodtenderBrown###Dart! Speak, Dart!
Snowdog###*arf!*
GodtenderBrown###Yes Archbishop Clancy, I wish to speak with your dog!
Adina###Williams! Perhaps you could... ask Dart to speak?
Snowdrunk###Oh god.
GodtenderBrown###Speak, Dart!
Snowdrunk###Woof.
Snowdog###*arf!*
Snowdrunk###Bark.
GodtenderBrown###Such spirit!
Snowdog###*woof!*
Snowdrunk###Arf.
GodtenderBrown###And yet I hear the weight of many gin-soaked years in him.
Adina###You are perceptive, Godtender!
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###Clancy is helping poor Dart turn his life around!
Snowdrunk###I hate all of you.
GodtenderBrown###What's that?
Adina###The air is very cold, may we pass through?
GodtenderBrown###Anyone with such a good-hearted, virtuous Archbishop
GodtenderBrown###and a dog of such moral fortitude and bravery
GodtenderBrown###must be worthy of inspection by the Forest God.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###WHAT DEVOTION!
Adina###He is a candidate for sainthood, where we come from.
Snowdrunk###He is amazing, Godtender.
GodtenderBrown###Beatification, while he yet lives?
GodtenderBrown###Who ever has heard of such a thing?
Not Stated###It's a special circumstance
Not Stated###He's not alive. He's a ghost
Adina###He's the secret son of the king.
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###So he's being fast-tracked to sainthood.
Snowdrunk###It's all so corrupt.
GodtenderBrown###That is unconscionable!
Adina###Hey, you don't have to convince me!
Snowdrunk###But it's not his fault.
Adina###He's just a nice, sweet guy
Snowdrunk###Who barks at animals
Adina###...and is thus my archbishop?
Snowdrunk###This was a good idea.
Adina###Can we pass now?
GodtenderBrown###Your dedication to this one barking holy man in your empire
GodtenderBrown###has convinced me that your heart is reverent and pure.
GodtenderBrown###You may pass.
Adina###Thank you so much!
GodtenderBrown###A GHOST?!?!?
GodtenderBrown###I'm sorry, but this is too spooky for me.
Adina###No, don't go!
Adina###Damn it.
Snowdrunk###Nice work!
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###EVERYBODY SHUT UP!
Adina###Godtender Brown, are you there?
GodtenderBrown###Yes?
Adina###Are you afraid of one little saintly ghost?
GodtenderBrown###Yes?
Adina###Oh, won't you come back and let us through?
GodtenderBrown###Can you promise me that your ghost will not spook me?
Adina###What do you think, Williams?
Snowdrunk###I believe we can do it, Empress!
Snowdog###*arf!*
GodtenderBrown###I will let you pass, on the condition that no one gets spooked.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###Do tell, Williams!
Snowdrunk###The Archbishop has spoken a blessing upon you
Snowdrunk###for allowing the Empress an audience with the Forest God.
GodtenderBrown###But I haven't let you pass yet!
Adina###Yes, but the Archbishop is possessed of forsight!
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###He's very intuitive!
GodtenderBrown###But how does he know the future is certain?
Adina###He sees all possibilities and knows which one shall be!
Snowdog###*arf!*
GodtenderBrown###Do I really have a choice then?
Snowdrunk###Sure!
Adina###SHHH!
Adina###No, it is fated that you shall let us pass.
GodtenderBrown###I feel now like whatever happens is inevitable.
Adina###But you got a blessing out of it!
GodtenderBrown###I hope the blessing will help me to understand this troubling idea.
Adina###May we pass?
GodtenderBrown###The intuitiveness of your companions has convinced me that you are worthy to pass.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###Archbishop Clancy, tell us what things you see!
Snowdrunk###uh
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###Williams, care to translate?
Snowdrunk###er...
Snowdog###*arf!*
Snowdrunk###"This blindfolded bear"
GodtenderBrown###That's me!
Snowdog###*arf!*
Snowdrunk###"should let the Empress pass"
GodtenderBrown###I can do that!
Adina###Excellent! Thank you!
Snowdog###*arf!*
GodtenderBrown###The vision continues!
Adina###um
Snowdrunk###"do you have any liquor"
Adina###no. stop.
GodtenderBrown###What?
Snowdog###*arf!*
Snowdrunk###My limited skills can no longer translate.
Adina###We must consign such wonders to the beasts.
Adina###The badgers. The stoats. The titmice. The bear-children.
GodtenderBrown###Amen.
GodtenderBrown###We witnessed a miracle, on Longest Night no less.
GodtenderBrown###You are most blessed, Empress.
GodtenderBrown###You may pass, and I ask that you leave some of that blessing here.
GodtenderBrown###Remarkable! There are other forests like this one?
Adina###Well, not exactly like this...
GodtenderBrown###Are there trees?
Adina###Yes. It would be hard to call it a forest if there weren't trees.
Snowthief###They have forests underwater.
Snowdrunk###What?
Snowthief###Made of seaweed.
Snowthief###I seen a man drowned.
Snowthief###The seaweed grabbed 'im like hair from a drowned ghost.
Snowthief###Dragged 'im down.
Snowdrunk###Ok.
Adina###Anyway,
GodtenderBrown###Oooh! I'm good and spooked now!
Not Stated###We have traveled long, past many an ocean-ghost.
Not Stated###Listen, that kind of thing doesn't exist.
GodtenderBrown###My father was from over the western ocean.
SnowThief###So am I! Small world.
GodtenderBrown###...is it?
SnowThief###What?
GodtenderBrown###I thought I recognized that voice.
SnowThief###No.
GodtenderBrown###DADDY!
Adina###No, he's not your father.
GodtenderBrown###DADDY'S COME BACK!
Not Stated###No, he really isn't your dad!
Not Stated###Uh, Archbishop Williams, will you council this confused man?
SnowThief###You're saying seaweed don't exist?
Adina###Yes, obviously that was what I was saying.
SnowThief###Well ok then, you're the expert on what exists.
GodtenderBrown###I'm sorry, but we do not allow sarcasm on the Holy Mountain.
Snowdrunk###Great.
GodtenderBrown###What a cynical empire you must hail from.
Adina###Listen, if we lay down our sarcasm, our cynicism, our irony
Adina###may we cross over to see the Forest God?
GodtenderBrown###Bring not one word of insincerity here!
GodtenderBrown###And you may pass. But watch yourself.
Adina###Thank you Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###I am afraid of ghosts
GodtenderBrown###and the ocean
GodtenderBrown###and horses, but I feel that's not relevant here.
Adina###Fair enough. Those are all scary things.
Adina###Even in my duties as an Empress,
Adina###the horrors of ghosts, the ocean, and horses.
Snowthief###The big three.
Snowdrunk###Horrifying.
Adina###May we pass?
GodtenderBrown###You have endured many terrors in your travels,
GodtenderBrown###but our shared fears can not harm us
GodtenderBrown###in the domain of the Forest God.
GodtenderBrown###You may pass.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
Snowdrunk###Why are you so ready to assume a stranger is your father?
Snowdrunk###It seems there's something there you need to deal with.
GodtenderBrown###Ever since daddy got kicked in the head by that horse
Snowthief###Do what now?
GodtenderBrown###daddy was always a trickster
GodtenderBrown###so maybe he isn't dead after all, and this is just the longest joke he ever pulled.
Adina###...
Snowthief###That's commitment.
GodtenderBrown###But you're right.
GodtenderBrown###And all these years of waiting, and hoping, and hating all horses...
Adina###I feel like we've all learned something tonight.
Snowdrunk###Bless you, my children.
Adina###May we pass?
GodtenderBrown###You are a wise man, Archbishop Williams
GodtenderBrown###and you are an insightful Empress, Astra.
GodtenderBrown###you may pass.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###Daddy was such a trickster.
GodtenderBrown###Ever since the day he got kicked in the head by that horse
GodtenderBrown###I've hoped this was just a very, very long joke.
Snowthief###You're kidding!
GodtenderBrown###Naive, I know...
Snowthief###No, I mean my mother was kicked in the head by a horse!
GodtenderBrown###huh!
Adina###Guys, my sister was kicked in the head by a horse.
GodtenderBrown###Wow!
Snowdrunk###My uncle was killed when a statue of a badger fell on him!
Snowdrunk###But I guess that isn't relevant here.
Adina###We've all lost so much because of horses.
GodtenderBrown###We are bound together by it.
Adina###May we pass?
GodtenderBrown###This moment we have shared, it is precious to me.
GodtenderBrown###And I feel as though you are good people who hate horses.
GodtenderBrown###You may pass.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###Glundinhorns hold the curse of eventual death for all who play them.
Adina###Wow.
GodtenderBrown###and extreme misfortune for all who hear them.
Snowblow###*Hoooooooooonk.*
Snowdrunk###Clearly.
Not Stated###And they let you play this in school?
Not Stated###But you're still alive?
GodTenderBrown###They didn't discover the curse until after I had acheived wisdom.
GodTenderBrown###The year they did the all Gludinhorn Midsummer Chorale.
GodTenderBrown###And the school fell into the earth.
Adina###Oh my god!
Snowblow###*HONK!!!*
Snowdrunk###Yeah that'll be a curse alright.
GodtenderBrown###And now you are cursed, for you have heard the Gludinhorn!
GodtenderBrown###And your poor herald is cursed with eventual death!
Snowdrunk###Oh no. Not that.
Snowblow###*Hooooooooonk.*
GodtenderBrown###Oh Stanislaus Glundin! The pain your horn has caused!
Adina###Please allow us to seek the wisdom of the Forest God
Adina###in regards to the cursed misfortunes myself and Imperial Advisor Willaims now anticipate.
GodtenderBrown###We share a curse. How can I refuse.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###The curse is eventual death. My days are numbered.
Adina###But that's...
Snowdrunk###That's just being mortal.
Snowblow###*Honk!*
GodtenderBrown###Yes, I'll never be immortal now.
Adina###Was that a possibility before?
GodtenderBrown###Who knows how these things work?
Snowdrunk###...
GodtenderBrown###The boy who sat in front in of me in the ensemble
GodtenderBrown###He heard my Glundinhorn thrice weekely.
GodtenderBrown###He suffered great misfortune when his horse kicked my father in the head.
Adina###Good god!
GodtenderBrown###My father had played the GlundinHorn before me.
GodtenderBrown###Oh Stanislaus Glundin! The pain your horn has caused!
Adina###Please allow us to seek the wisdom of the Forest God
Adina###in regards to the cursed misfortunes myself and Imperial Advisor Willaims now anticipate.
GodtenderBrown###We share a curse. How can I refuse.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###Glundinhorns hold the curse of eventual death for all who play them.
Adina###Really?
GodtenderBrown###and extreme misfortune for all who hear them.
Snowblow###*Hoooooooooonk.*
Snowthief###Shocking.
Not Stated###Yeah, you're kidding, right?
Not Stated###But you're still alive?
GodtenderBrown###I would never kid about the curse that took daddy away.
Snowthief###ugh... "daddy"
Adina###I'm sorry to hear of your father's death, Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###It was his Gludinhorn that I played.
GodtenderBrown###We shared the doom of eventual death, which is something to share indeed.
Snowblow###*Hoooooonk.*
GodtenderBrown###But praise the Forest God. In the church I found a new family.
Snowblow###*Honk!*
Adina###That is lovely.
GodtenderBrown###I'm not seeking to replace my father, but I've made so many friends.
GodtenderBrown###Father Carmel, Father Perpa, Father Patience Forget-Not-God...
Adina###*urk*
Snowthief###I'm sorry can we talk about how no one should use the word "daddy"?
Adina###Godtender, in recognition of the family you find when your family is gone,
Adina###may we bring out cares and curses to the Forest God?
GodtenderBrown###We share the curse of this horn, which has taken so much,
GodtenderBrown###and will take more still.
GodtenderBrown###you may pass.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###The dread curse of the Gludinhorn is the ever-present shadow of death
GodtenderBrown###and one day, perhaps tomorrow, perhaps when you are old
GodtenderBrown###it will find you.
SnowThief###How unnatural.
SnowHorn###*Hoooooonk.*
Adina###That's not really a curse in the classic sense.
GodtenderBrown###It kills you! How much worse can it be?
Adina###Were you expecting to live forever before you played the horn?
GodtenderBrown###Who knows, nothing is certain.
SnowThief###Well, at least one thing is.
GodtenderBrown###Someday we must all hear the horn, we who have heard the horn.
Adina###Godtender, may we bring our cares and curses to the Forest God?
GodtenderBrown###We all share a doom. A horn-doom.
GodtenderBrown###How can I deny my doom-mates?
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###Brass? Twisted around? Blow into one end?
Adina###That's most horns I think.
GodtenderBrown###Well, you can tell after the fact, because GludinHorns are cursed.
Snowhorn###*HONK?!*
Adina###What?!
GodtenderBrown###The Gludinhorn curses all who hear it to misfortune,
GodtenderBrown###and those who play it to eventual death.
Snowhorn###*Hooooooooonk.*
Adina###I don't think that'll be a problem here.
Snowdog###*Hooooooowl!*
GodtenderBrown###My father was a Gludinhorn player, as was I
GodtenderBrown###And now death lies in my future.
Adina###Isn't that the case for all of us?
GodtenderBrown###Who even knows what would have happened.
Adina###I have to say, probably death.
GodtenderBrown###Who even knows.
Adina###May we pass?
GodtenderBrown###We have so much in common.
GodtenderBrown###We are all cold, and all of us will someday die
GodtenderBrown###or in your case, suffer great misfortune.
GodtenderBrown###You may pass.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###How does this relationship work?
Adina###He is highly intuitive.
Snowhorn###*HONK!*
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###No, he barks once for yes, and twice for no.
GodtenderBrown###Oh! Ask him a question!!!!
Adina###Um...
Adina###Clancy, will Godtender Brown allow us passage?
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###Hey, look!
GodtenderBrown###Amazing!
Snowdog###*arf!* *arf!*
GodtenderBrown###What does this mean?
Adina###He's just excited.
GodtenderBrown###That is understandable.
GodtenderBrown###Are you excited to meet the Forest God, Clancy?
Snowdog###*arf!* *arf!*
GodtenderBrown###Wait, that was twice for no, right?
Snowblow###*HONK!*
Snowdog###*arf!* *arf!*
Adina###I think that makes it a double negative.
GodtenderBrown###He's not not excited to meet the Forest God?
GodtenderBrown###Then I am not not not letting you pass!
Adina###So that's... a triple...
GodtenderBrown###No, I meant not not not not. Quadruple!
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###Can we pass?
GodtenderBrown###Your willingness to seek council among even the beasts
GodtenderBrown###says volumes about your wisdom and devotion to your people.
GodtenderBrown###You may pass.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###Hello?
GodtenderBrown###Please do not unnecessarily ring the red bell!
Adina###Hello!
GodtenderBrown###Hello traveler!
GodtenderBrown###And who are you?
Adina###Adina! An astronomer! I seek an audience with the Forest God!
GodtenderBrown###I'm sorry, Adina, but the Forest God will not entertain you.
GodtenderBrown###Kings, emperors, ones of high import
GodtenderBrown###only those am I permitted to allow through.
Adina###But I'm important! I'm an... empress!
GodtenderBrown###I may wear a blindfold, but I can hear that you are alone.
GodtenderBrown###And no empress would travel alone.
GodtenderBrown###This is highly improper.
Adina###This is highly annoying.
GodtenderBrown###If you are indeed an empress, bring your entourage here
GodtenderBrown###and we shall discuss the situation.
GodtenderBrown###Until then, have a pleasant Longest Night!
Adina###...thanks...
GodtenderBrown###I still can't hear your companions.
Adina###O-oh, they'll be right along in a minute...
Snowdrunk###...
Adina###Eimhin???
Snowthief###Oh yeah, this dog barks straight at god.
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###He was born with one ear that was white as the snow
Adina###and that's the ear he uses to hear the celestial realms.
GodtenderBrown###Amazing!
Snowdog###*arf!*
Snowthief###Yeah, he's pretty-
Snowdog###*arf!* *arf!*
Snowdrunk###-great for a-
Snowdog###*arf!* *arf!* *woof!* *bark!* *woof!* *arf!* *woof!* *arf!* *bark!*
Snowthief###I am going to kick this mutt right off this cliff.
GodtenderBrown###What's that?
Not Stated###Eimhin was just having an intuition!
Not Stated###Clancy is receiving a vision right this moment!
GodtenderBrown###SIGNS AND WONDERS!!!!
Adina###When Clancy was but a child
Adina###He longed to bring peace to the beasts of the field.
Snowthief###Yep. Beasts of the field. That's what he did.
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###And he was blessed with the ability to speak to them.
GodtenderBrown###Why does he not speak to us?
Snowthief###He's profoundly stupid?
Adina###Stupid with wisdom, that is!
GodtenderBrown###What?
Not Stated###He has forgotten how to speak, such is his dedication.
Not Stated###He is currently speaking to our Imperial Hound, Dart.
GodtenderBrown###WHAT DEVOTION!
Adina###He is a candidate for sainthood, where we come from.
Snowthief###It's a very low bar to hurdle.
GodtenderBrown###Beatification, while he yet lives?
GodtenderBrown###Who ever has heard of such a thing?
Not Stated###It's a special circumstance
Not Stated###He's not alive. He's a ghost
GodtenderBrown###Oh, you have a dog with you as well! I love dogs!
GodtenderBrown###Dart! Speak, Dart!
Snowdog###*arf!*
GodtenderBrown###Yes Archbishop Clancy, I wish to speak with your dog!
Adina###Eimhin! Perhaps you could... ask Dart to speak?
Snowthief###Uuuuuuuuugghhhh.
GodtenderBrown###Speak, Dart!
Snowthief###Woof.
Snowdog###*arf!*
Snowthief###Bark.
GodtenderBrown###Such spirit!
Snowdog###*woof!*
Snowthief###Arf.
GodtenderBrown###And yet I hear an unearned cynicism in his voice.
Adina###You are perceptive, Godtender!
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###Clancy is helping poor Dart turn his life around!
Snowthief###I was having such a great day, being dead...
GodtenderBrown###What's that?
Adina###The air is very cold, may we pass through?
GodtenderBrown###Anyone with such a good-hearted, virtuous Archbishop
GodtenderBrown###and a dog of such moral fortitude and bravery
GodtenderBrown###must be worthy of inspection by the Forest God.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###Do tell, Eimhin!
Snowthief###The Archbishop says good job on letting us pass.
GodtenderBrown###But I haven't yet!
Adina###Yes, but the Archbishop is possessed of forsight!
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###He's very intuitive!
GodtenderBrown###But how does he know the future is certain?
Adina###He sees all possibilities and knows which one shall be!
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###it is fated that you shall let us pass.
GodtenderBrown###I feel now like whatever happens is inevitable.
Adina###But you got a "good job" out of it!
GodtenderBrown###I hope this blessing will help me to understand this troubling idea.
Snowthief###Don't strain yourself.
Adina###May we pass?
GodtenderBrown###The intuitiveness of your companions has convinced me that you are worthy to pass.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
GodtenderBrown###Archbishop Clancy, tell us what things you see!
Snowthief###uh
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###Eimhin, care to translate?
Snowthief###Sure.
Snowdog###*arf!*
Snowthief###"This blindfolded oaf"
GodtenderBrown###That's me! I am such an oaf!
Snowdog###*arf!*
Snowthief###"should let the Empress pass"
GodtenderBrown###I can do that!
Adina###Excellent! Thank you!
Snowdog###*arf!*
GodtenderBrown###The vision continues!
Adina###um
Snowthief###"Beware the horn, beware the horse"?
Adina###What?
GodtenderBrown###What!?
Snowdog###*arf!*
Snowthief###I think I actually had something there for a minute.
Adina###We must consign such wonders to the beasts.
Adina###The badgers. The stoats. The titmice. The bear-children.
GodtenderBrown###Amen.
GodtenderBrown###We witnessed a miracle, on Longest Night no less.
GodtenderBrown###You are most blessed, Empress.
GodtenderBrown###You may pass, and I ask that you leave some of that blessing here.
GodtenderBrown###A GHOST?!?!?
GodtenderBrown###I'm sorry, but this is too spooky for me.
Adina###No, don't go!
Adina###Damn it.
Snowthief###Wow. What a wuss.
Snowthief###Hey, you sure did screw that up!
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###EVERYBODY SHUT UP!
Adina###Godtender Brown, are you there?
GodtenderBrown###Yes?
Adina###Are you afraid of one little saintly ghost?
GodtenderBrown###Yes?
Adina###Oh, won't you come back and let us through?
GodtenderBrown###Can you promise me that your ghost will not spook me?
Adina###What do you think, Eimhin?
SnowthiefBrown###Yeah I have my anti-spooking hat on or whatever.
Snowdog###*arf!*
GodtenderBrown###I will let you pass, on the condition that no one gets spooked.
Adina###Thank you, Godtender!
Adina###He's the secret son of the king.
Snowdog###*arf!*
Adina###So he's being fast-tracked to sainthood.
Snowthief###Seriously. Totally hecked up.
GodtenderBrown###That is unconscionable!
Adina###Hey, you don't have to convince me!
Snowthief###But listen, it's not his fault.
Adina###He's just a nice, sweet guy
Snowthief###Who barks at animals
Adina###...and is thus my archbishop?
Snowthief###*sigh*
Adina###Can we pass now?
GodtenderBrown###Your dedication to this one barking holy man in your empire
GodtenderBrown###has convinced me that your heart is reverent and pure.
GodtenderBrown###You may pass.
Adina###Thank you so much!
Adina###That's a blindfold, right?
GodtenderBrown###It's a blinder.
Adina###Why do you wear it?
GodtenderBrown###Someone may steal the image of the Forest God
GodtenderBrown###from where it was reflected in my eyes
GodtenderBrown###and it would be a blasphemy to do such a thing.
Not Stated###Is that a common problem?
Not Stated###Aren't you worried about falling off this mountain?
GodtenderBrown###I walk by faith, and my steps are made sure by the Forest God.
Adina###Well, I guess you're still here.
GodtenderBrown###See?
GodtenderBrown###A wind demon once stole the reflection from a Godtender's Eyes.
GodtenderBrown###And placed it on the surface of a mirror.
GodtenderBrown###To convince a king that he was a god.
Adina###Why?
GodtenderBrown###The king jumped from a high tower, thinking he could fly.
GodtenderBrown###And the demon entered his broken body
GodtenderBrown###And ruled his kingdom for 99 years
GodtenderBrown###until he was driven out by Saint Balfa and the Charmed Goat.
Adina###So the wind demon was just a jerk then.
GodtenderBrown###It's a demon. What are you gonna do?
Adina###Where is everyone?
GodtenderBrown###They are in the hills performing Longest Night services.
GodtenderBrown###They will be back by dawn.
Adina###Why aren't you with them?
GodtenderBrown###Oh, I don't have a congregation.
GodtenderBrown###It is my job to meet pilgrims at the chasm.
Adina###Godtender, can I ask a personal question?
GodtenderBrown###Of course.
Not Stated###What does all of this do for you?
Not Stated###Aren't you very, very, very cold?
Adina###Oh no. Poor Stevenson...
Adina###Looks like this thing took a beating from something huge, so...
Adina###I wonder if there's a head in there?
Adina###...
Adina###Not checking.
Mae###Why wouldn't she check?
Mae###I would.
Granddad###So would I.
Mae###If I ever find a body part on the ground
Mae###I am gonna poke it with a stick.
Granddad###Can't argue with you there.
Adina###Poor Stevenson.
Snowdrunk###Oh hello.
Adina###Hey! Thanks for helping me out back there!
Snowdrunk###Thanks for helping me get out of here.
Adina###How did you end up here, anyway?
Snowdrunk###He was dead.
Snowdrunk###I was drunk.
Snowdrunk###The frozen lake was east.
Snowdrunk###And then I was dead too.
Adina###Oh.
Snowdrunk###Kinda nice up here. Peaceful.
Snowdrunk###...
Adina###Oh, you're already gone, huh?
Snowdrunk###...
Adina###I hope you're going someplace better.
Adina###Thanks.
Adina###Hey you!
Snowthief###Hey YOU!
Adina###So, who are you?
Snowthief###I was an exceptional thief.
Adina###How did you end up in the forest?
Snowthief###I was going to rob the Huncher.
Snowthief###She's been there forever.
Snowthief###She's got to have loads of priceless crap.
Adina###How did that go?
Snowthief###I remember reaching up, trying to grab the sun
Snowthief###as the snow covered me.
Snowthief###You do dumb half-asleep things when you die.
Adina###Huh.
Snowthief###There's your deep insight on the dying process.
Adina###Appreciate it.
Snowthief###I'm bored.
Snowthief###...she's got it...
Adina###She's got what?
Snowthief###It was a lock and a key. Only one set like them.
Adina###Yeah?
Snowthief###...
Adina###Hello?
Snowthief###...
Adina###thanks, thiefy.
Adina###i never said- thanks for the arm.
GodtenderBrown###The blessing of the Forest God goes with you.
GodtenderBrown###Hm.
Adina###Sorry, is that a weird question?
GodtenderBrown###No, not at all.
GodtenderBrown###I think it gives me a truth I can't find anywhere else.
GodtenderBrown###And one I have to find every day when I wake up.
GodtenderBrown###Like, it's there, but I don't have a map to it.
GodtenderBrown###and looking for it is where I find everything else.
Adina###Wait, but isn't the Forest God in there right now?
Adina###Where is the mystery in what you're looking for?
GodtenderBrown###The Forest God does not behave as I always expect
GodtenderBrown###and the difference between my expectations and reality
GodtenderBrown###is mystery enough.
Adina###Fair enough. Thank you.
GodtenderBrown###You are quite welcome.
GodtenderBrown###I can only hope that the Forest God may heal.
GodtenderBrown###ha ha ha ha ha!
GodtenderBrown###I am from the country of giants!
GodtenderBrown###I am wearing the thickest of coats
GodtenderBrown###and the warmest of our Godtender hats.
GodtenderBrown###there isn't a chill frosty enough to touch these bones.
Adina###ha ha ha. ok.
GodtenderBrown###Aren't you cold?
Adina###Yes. Freezing. Thanks.
Mae###And then she jumped over the kazm!
Granddad###It's "chasm," and no she didn't.
Mae###Why not?
Granddad###The gap was too wide. She would have never made it.
Mae###But she totally cou-
Granddad###That's not how it happened.
Mae###She jumped across!
Granddad###No she didn't.
Mae###She was an expert ski jumper. She could have made it across easily!
Granddad###She wasn't. They didn't have skiing back then.
Mae###What did they have?
Granddad###Slidey-snowshoes.
Mae###She jumped across with her slidey-snowshoes!
Granddad###Mae.
Mae###Granddad.
Granddad###Anyway...
Mae###She jumped across anyway!
Granddad###No, the gap was too wide.
Mae###No it wasn't! I can see it.
Granddad###Well I can see it too and it's my story.
Mae###If you can say she couldn't I can say she could!
Granddad###Ugggggh...
Mae###She jumped because it's my story now!
Granddad###Ok then. She jumped across
Granddad###and I don't know what happened after that.
Mae###Aw.
Granddad###I thought it was your story now?
Mae###Well...
Granddad###Maybe the story is both of ours?
Mae###That sounds good.
Granddad###How about we work together?
Mae###Ok.
Granddad###So anyway, she couldn't jump over the cliff...
Mae###FIIIIIIIIIIINE.
Mae###And then... oh right. She didn't jump.
Granddad###Thank you, Mae.
Adina###Hey cat. Figured I'd see you here.
TreeCat###You figured right.
Adina###You figured wrong.
TreeCat###How's that?
Adina###I didn't die in there.
TreeCat###So you didn't.
TreeCat###But then again, I've never died in there either.
TreeCat###So pardon me if I'm not overly impressed you did it once.
Adina###You are such an ass.
TreeCat###You certainly caused a lot of trouble tonight.
Adina###I didn't mean to. Just passing through.
TreeCat###Isn't that always the way.
Not Stated###I have to go now.
Not Stated###So who are you, really?
Astronomer###You know, I doubted you would make it.
Adina###A promise is a promise.
Astronomer###How is home?
Adina###Same as ever. Colder now of course.
Adina###The sheep shut down the 5th street bridge again on Longest Night eve.
Astronomer###Ha ha ha!
Adina###The farmers were there all day trying to pull them off.
Astronomer###Have they figured out why they keep doing that?
Adina###No one has a clue.
Astronomer###Hm.
Adina###I know you can't stay long.
Astronomer###I can't. So ask.
Adina###Ok, did you find the ghost star?
Astronomer###I did, my first night dead.
Astronomer###It's there.
Adina###Oh my god.
Astronomer###Something like that.
Astronomer###Will you remember where that is?
Adina###Yes.
Adina###It's funny.
Astronomer###What is?
Adina###It's always been there.
Adina###I just had no way of seeing it.
Astronomer###You still can't, not really.
Astronomer###But you can chart where it is.
Astronomer###That's something at least.
Adina###Wow.
Adina###I feel like just a few feet away
Adina###there's this thing, bigger than I can think about,
Adina###burning away. Exploding.
Adina###And between us is this sheet of black.
Adina###And when I think about it I feel like I'm going to overflow.
Astronomer###I think about this a lot these days.
Astronomer###We devote ourselves to something we barely understand,
Astronomer###something we can never touch.
Astronomer###We give it a name, and we give ourselves a name for doing so.
Astronomer###All of it creates this connection.
Astronomer###And that connection, that becomes the thing we can touch.
Astronomer###You appreciate those connections even more after you've died.
Adina###I'm gonna miss you all over again now.
Astronomer###Well, on the bright side, you got a star out of it.
Adina###That's something, at least.
Astronomer###Ha ha ha.
Astronomer###Pretty amazing to be something, at least.
Adina###Yeah.
Astronomer###Goodbye, Astronomer.
Adina###Goodbye, Astronomer.
Granddad###The End.
Mae###What constellation was it?
Granddad###No one knows. It's lost to history.
Mae###Did this really happen?
Granddad###Does it matter if it really happened?
Mae###I think it does.
Granddad###Well, we'll never know.
Granddad###But hearing it happened to you.
Granddad###And that's something.
Mae###Something something something.
Mae###I want to find that constellation.
Granddad###Go outside some night and find it.
Granddad###and tell me where it is, ok?
Mae###*yawn*
Granddad###You look tuckered out, kid.
Mae###I am.
Granddad###I'll leave you to it.
Granddad###sweet dreams, kiddo.
Mae###zzz
TreeCat###The Huncher, her child, the Forest God- those aren't your business.
Adina###I know.
TreeCat###Leave all of that here. You were in their forest.
Adina###I'm an astronomer.
Adina###It may be their forest, but it's under my sky.
TreeCat###ha ha ha. i bet that sounded great in your head.
Adina###It sounded great when I said it, asscat.
TreeCat###Goodbye, Adina The Astronomer. Good luck.
Adina###Goodbye, Cat. Happy Longest Night.
TreeCat###Pardon?
Adina###You some magical cat? Cat god? Cat wizard? Something?
TreeCat###I'm just a cat.
TreeCat###I live near the woods.
TreeCat###I like shiny things.
TreeCat###And I listen.
Adina###Oh.
TreeCat###Your turn. Who are you?
Not Stated###I'm an astronomer.
Not Stated###I'm a survivor.
Adina###I'm here because there's something missing in the sky.
Adina###And this is where I'll find it.
TreeCat###Are you sure?
Adina###At this point I'm so exhausted and cold
Adina###that I can't afford to not be sure.
TreeCat###That's either very sad or very beautiful.
Adina###It's very true.
Adina###I'm freezing.
TreeCat###Prrrrr.
Adina###Where I come from, where I was tonight.
Adina###I've survived.
TreeCat###Survival is good.
TreeCat###Steal Everything. Never get caught.
TreeCat###Eat rats. Find the warmest barn.
Adina###Not how I'd put it, but yes.
TreeCat###How would you put it?
Adina###Just get through the damn forest.
Adina###I like the stars. They're out there hanging in black.
Adina###Mawkish, yeah.
Adina###The darker it gets...
TreeCat###Prrrr.
TreeCat###Prrrr.
Adina###Travis?!? What are *you* doing here?
Astronomer###How do you even know who I am?
Mae###And then Travis told her off...
Granddad###Who's Travis?
Mae###This really annoying kid at school.
Granddad###Why would this Travis character exist in the past?
Mae###Because he stole a time machine.
Granddad###Right, right.
Mae###Anyways, so then Travis said...
Astronomer###...I stole a time machine and that's why I'm here to annoy you.
Adina###O-okay.
Astronomer###So. You should be annoyed.
Adina###Yeah. You're pretty annoying.
Adina###Welp.
Astronomer###Have a good one.
Adina###cya later
TreeCat###Talk to me again.
HuncherOutside###Who's that walking on my porch?
Adina###Hello?
HuncherOutside###Oh girl, it's all over now.
HuncherInside###There are old bodies in the north.
HuncherInside###Where the ground never thaws.
HuncherInside###Frozen in the dirt and ice for millenia.
HuncherInside###In some of them there is a sickness against which we are no longer strong.
HuncherInside###Someday the earth will warm, and the ice will melt.
HuncherInside###And that sickness will finish the work on us
HuncherInside###that began when we were first born.
Adina###...
HuncherInside###KID! Will you please stop that honking?
HuncherKid###Nope.
HuncherInside###Fine, kid, fine.
HuncherInside###I'm going to leave you where they'll never find you.
HuncherKid###Ha ha ha.
Not Stated###I'm sorry, am I interrupting something?
Not Stated###I need to get to the Frozen Lake.
HuncherInside###Stop.
Adina###UGHK!
Adina###I can't move. This hurts. Stop.
HuncherInside###Come no closer.
HuncherInside###Stop.
Adina###UGHK!
Adina###!!!
Adina###Here she comes...
Adina###I need somewhere to hide!
Adina###To the brambles!
Adina###Ready!
HuncherOutside###Damn Squirrels!
HuncherOutside###Damn Squirrels won't take a break.
HuncherOutside###Squirrels?
HuncherOutside###Squirrels.
HuncherOutside###North wind, black wind, wolf in the dark!
HuncherOutside###Ugh, this weather never behaves.
HuncherOutside###Gotta say the whole damn thing every time.
HuncherOutside###Blue fire in the north! I have discovered your secret name!
HuncherOutside###I have buried it deep in the earth, and upon it built a house!
HuncherOutside###You must obey this house!
HuncherOutside###Now, blow west!
HuncherOutside###Ok, that's done.
HuncherOutside###Down you go!
HuncherOutside###Stay off my porch!
HuncherOutside###Accept it! You're freezing in the brambles tonight!
HuncherOutside###Get away!
Adina###There was something in that house. If I was just quick enough...
Adina###Need something special for this.
Adina###Oh god, I have to get back into that house.
Adina###This is the worst Longest Night ever.
Snowproblem###...
HuncherInside###When you're out there tonight, freezing,
HuncherInside###will you look for my ring?
HuncherInside###Once something's down in the brambles I can never see it.
HuncherKid###I found your ring last week.
HuncherInside###Oh! So you did.
HuncherInside###It's my second most prized possession.
HuncherInside###I keep the most prized in a shrine, so precious is it to me.
HuncherInside###And so painful. We have to keep the precious and painful close.
Adina###I feel like we keep getting off-track here.
HuncherInside###*sniff sniff*
HuncherInside###I can smell the Forest God's blessing on you.
HuncherInside###If you knew anything you'd wash until it came off with your skin.
HuncherInside###When you leave, you're going down into the brambles like all the others.
HuncherInside###When I have to go outside to fix the weather
HuncherInside###because the weathervane got knocked around, AGAIN...
HuncherKid###It's a really stupid system you have going there.
HuncherInside###...when I get out to do that
HuncherInside###I'll look out on the hollow, and nothing will be stirring.
HuncherInside###And that will be what happened to you.
Adina###Why don't you just kill me now, then?
HuncherInside###Because of that smell.
HuncherInside###I think you know the answer. You just showed up.
HuncherInside###Ugh, we all just show up.
HuncherInside###Staying is the problem.
HuncherInside###But you won't have to worry about that.
HuncherInside###Will you?
Not Stated###Is that an extremely vague threat?
Not Stated###Actually, I need to get to the Frozen Lake.
HuncherKid###Her? Vague threats?
HuncherInside###Oh, I'll get specific with you, kid.
HuncherInside###I'm going to bury your pieces in a lonely hollow.
HuncherInside###Not even bury them! I didn't bury the last one.
HuncherInside###And SHE did chores!
HuncherInside###Your family will never find you.
HuncherKid###Oh no. Not that.
Not Stated###Is this your normal dynamic?
Not Stated###*AHEM.* I need to get to the Frozen Lake.
HuncherInside###This is the dynamic of everything.
HuncherInside###No different for her.
HuncherInside###They didn't even give you a name back at the sawmill, did they, kid?
HuncherInside###Just kid?
HuncherKid###Excuse me, the full name was Sawmill Kid.
HuncherInside###Well, now you're just kid.
Adina###They didn't name you?
HuncherKid###...
HuncherInside###You never realize how little and how much you need a name
HuncherInside###until they refuse you yours.
Adina###Huh.
Adina###I'm sorry to keep steering us back to this,
Adina###but I must reach the Frozen Lake.
HuncherInside###What are you, anyway?
Adina###I'm an astronomer. Former apprentice.
Adinda###First in my observatory, actually.
HuncherInside###Oh honey, all of those stars in your head.
HuncherInside###They will go out like candles tonight.
Adina###What are you?
HuncherInside###The Forest God isn't really a god.
HuncherInside###I am twice their size.
HuncherInside###I am twice as real.
HuncherInside###Honestly, whoever you are, even you're twice as real as they are.
Adina###Adina. Adina Astra.
HuncherInside###A ridiculous name. You named yourself. I can tell.
HuncherInside###...just the last part.
HuncherInside###Now, what would make a little girl change her last name?
Adina###Nothing you'd understand.
HuncherInside###You don't know a thing about it. I came from somewhere.
HuncherInside###As did the woman before me.
HuncherInside###And we found the cabin, and I fed the oven.
HuncherInside###And we survived, and then I survived.
HuncherInside###And the quarrel with the Forest God went on for centuries.
HuncherInside###Until it ended. Quite recently.
HuncherKid###Well-
HuncherInside###SHUT IT, KID.
HuncherInside###I swear if I wasn't physically present in here she'd talk about anything.
Adina###Are you a witch?
HuncherInside###What is a witch? You mean the women in the woods?
HuncherInside###A man in the woods is a hermit or a woodsman or a huntsman.
HuncherInside###They didn't have a name for women who weren't where they should be.
HuncherInside###So they stole a name they feared and hated
HuncherInside###and pressed it onto us.
HuncherKid###Onto you. The word they use for girls like me is "kidnapped".
HuncherInsdie###*sigh*
HuncherInside###This one. Every day, I swear.
HuncherInside###Won't do chores.
HuncherInside###Back-sass. Sass-mouth.
Adina###Why not send her back where she came from?
HuncherInside###That is the one question to which I have no answer.
HuncherInside###We're done talking.
HuncherInside###I'm sorry, Adina Astra.
HuncherInside###I know you wanted to live
HuncherInside###But I've taken that future from you
HuncherInside###And it's mine now.
HuncherInside###And you can't take it back.
Snowproblem###What? No. No.
Snowproblem###*cough* *cough* *cough*
Snowproblem###NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
HuncherOutside###What is this?
HuncherOutside###Oh. Oh god. No.
HuncherOutside###Girl, what have you done?
HuncherSisterGhost###You... you watched it happen!
HuncherSisterGhost###[wave][size=.75]YOU WAAAAAAAAAAAAAATCHED!
HuncherOutside###It wasn't me! It was this place!
HuncherSisterGhost###It was the oven. It was what you became.
HuncherOutside###I didn't get to choose what happened to me!
HuncherSisterGhost###I was so cold. I was so afraid.
HuncherOutside###I had to survive!
HuncherSisterGhost###and I did not.
Adina###What is this? Who are you?
HuncherOutside###Don't you dare speak, you waste of a girl.
HuncherSisterGhost###I was her twin! We fled into the woods, identical in all things
HuncherSisterGhost###except one.
HuncherSisterGhost###When she pulled my body from the water
HuncherSisterGhost###the only part of me she kept
HuncherSisterGhost###was the tattoo.
HuncherOutside###I've kept it close to me all down the centuries.
HuncherSisterGhost###I believed in some idea of you...
HuncherSisterGhost###that is as long dead as i am now.
HuncherSisterGhost###but you survived.
HuncherOutside###I... I...
Adina###Oh my god. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for this.
HuncherOutside###Get out.
Adina###I'm sorry!!! I never meant to-
HuncherOutside###[shake=.05]GET OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUT!
Mae###...
Granddad###Yes, Mae?
Mae###What is this story about?
Granddad###What do you want it to be about?
Mae###If I get to choose what it's about, it's not about anything.
Granddad###Huh. That's quite a statement.
Mae###I'm really smart.
Granddad###Well you came up with that plan to rob banks
Granddad###so clearly you're onto something.
Mae###I want to know what this is about.
Granddad###I think you have to figure that out on your own.
Mae###...
Mae###I don't like that.
Adina###I can get you out of here.
HuncherKid###You can't even get yourself out of here.
HuncherKid###I can barely get out of the attic
HuncherKid###and away from that extremely creepy shrine.
Adina###It's not safe for you here.
HuncherKid###Did you know, I made that poison and she never even thanked me?
HuncherKid###She'll take all the credit for it!
Adina###what?
HuncherKid###I know, right?
HuncherKid###Murdering a god isn't something you want to let someone else take credit for.
Adina###Oh my god.
Adina###I thought you were...
HuncherKid###I'm going to survive.
HuncherKid###Nobody who would know I'm gone is anyone I'd want to find me.
Adina###I need to go.
HuncherKid###Get away if you can.
Adina###The huncher is about!
Adina###Hm.
Adina###Should probably check that house first.
Adina###Ok, time to build.
Adina###Some of that weird snow is way up in the trees.
Adina###Need a good strong wind.
Adina###Ha ha ha. Just need to control the wind is all. Simple.
Adina###Ugh.
Adina###I am not going to die here tonight.
Adina###I'm just not.
Adina###I need to see what's in this hollow.
Adina###I need to get into that house.
Adina###Ok, let's go.
Adina###I'm so cold. So cold.
Adina###No.
Adina###I'm an Astronomer.
Adina###Those are my skies, damn it.
Adina###I'm gonna survive this.
Adina###She seems distracted by that weather thing.
Adina###Maybe... hmm...
Mae###Where is this place?
Granddad###Back where your great-great-grandparents came from, before they came to this country.
Granddad###But long before they were born and longer still before that.
Not Stated###Do they have Longest Night there?
Not Stated###They had Longest Night then?!
Granddad###They do indeed!
Mae###Do they give presents?
Granddad###Those who can!
Mae###They should all can.
Granddad###What do... yeah ok. Anyway.
Granddad###There's always been a Longest Night.
Granddad###Even back before they came up with a name for it.
Mae###What did they call it back then?
Granddad###Longest Night.
Mae###Oh.
Adina###Cat! Hey cat!
Adina###Do you live in this forest?
TreeCat###Near enough.
Adina###Can I ask you a question?
TreeCat###You're going to die in there tonight.
Adina###Wow. That is unhelpful.
TreeCat###Is it?
Not Stated###Where are you going tonight?
Not Stated###Go away, cat!
TreeCat###I'm visiting my relations, but first I'll go to church.
Adina###That sounds like your standard Longest Night.
TreeCat###Before church, I'll hunt up a vole.
TreeCat###And eat it.
TreeCat###And before that, I'll watch you walk into the woods
TreeCat###To die.
TreeCat###And before that, we'll say goodbye.
Adina###Are you so sure?
TreeCat###Prrrrr.
Adina###Well, goodbye!
TreeCat###HA HA HA HA.
Adina###What are you-
Adina###Oh I see.
TreeCat###Goodbye.
TreeCat###I'm on my way down the hills tonight, but I'll be back.
TreeCat###I collect shiny things
TreeCat###from the cold pockets
TreeCat###of fools like you.
Adina###Stop bothering me!
TreeCat###I think it's you who bothered me?
Adina###Get going then!
TreeCat###There's always a moment to watch a fool make her last mistake.
Adina###Oh very nice. That's helpful.
Adina###...asscat...
TreeCat###Prrrr.
Adina###Well, a good Longest Night to you!
TreeCat###I'll be going through your pockets by morning!
Adina###Ok thanks!
TreeCat###Goodbye!
TreeCat###Prrrr.
Adina###Hello again!
King###Ah, we meet again!
Advisor###I hope you are faring well!
King###We were just leaving!
Adina###Why?
Advisor###Because a kingdom needs a king!
King###And this king needs his trusted advisor!
Adina###What happened to your sword guy?
King###STEVENSON!
Advisor###HE HAD A NAME, YOU KNOW.
Adina###Sorry! What happened to him? Did you see the forest god?
Advisor###STEEEEVEEEEENSOOOOON!
King###We're going home now. I command it and I'm king.
Advisor###Yes. Home now.
King###I'm going to call a late-night feast!
Advisor###It'll be a new tradition, sire!
King###This will be the best Longest Night ever!
Advisor###Too true!
Adina###Well, happy Longest Night-
King###The *BEST* Longest Night!
Adina###Yes, that!
King###Be safe!
King###Let's sing a Longest Night carol!
Advisor###Yes, that will raise our spirits!
SnowfieldNPC###Hi, I'm a potential last-minute inclusion that would be a short conversation about how the Forest God is actually pretty dangerous! Also, the stars!
Adina###Wow, that'd be cool!
SnowfieldNPC###Yep, probably just single sprite sequence or something with some dialogue.
Adina###Well, we'll see if we have time!
SnowfieldNPC###Fingers crossed!
Adina###I found his... helmet.
Advisor###Where was it?
Adina###It was back on the Forest God's mountain, you could just-
King###NNNNNOPE!
Advisor###Not going back there!
Adina###Did he attack the Forest God?
King###He would never do that! I would never order that!
Advisor###Stevenson was a dear, dear man, and-
King###Steady, old friend.
Advisor###I shall be steady, sire.
Adina###What happened?
King###Nothing.
Advisor###Nothing happened.
King###I'm king and I say we go home now.
Advisor###Excellent idea, sire.
King###Safe journeys, whatever your name is!
Adina###Adina.
Advisor###Safe journeys, whoever you are!
Adina###Adina.
King###Goodbye.
King###La la la la!
Advisor###Bum bum bum da bum bum bum!
Mae###Where does this happen?
Granddad###Back where my grandparents came from, but long before they lived.
Mae###Did they have longest night back then?
Granddad###They did!
Mae###What did they call it?
Granddad###Longest night.
Mae###Oh.
Adina###Far from home here, alright.
Adina###Could just go back...
Adina###No.
Adina###It's been a year, and you made a promise.
Adina###Get ahold of yourself.
Adina###You're not gonna die in there tonight.
Adina###You're gonna see her again.
Adina###and come back with a star.
Adina###I think the fog is clearing!
Adina###Wow this fog is too thick.
Adina###Weird fog.
Adina###How do you get rid of weird fog?
Adina###Go away, fog!
Adina###Ugh. How do I get rid of you?
Mae###I'm gonna rob the bank!
Granddad###Ha ha ha. You want to spend longest night in jail?
Mae###Gonna rob 'em to death!
Mae###They'll never catch me!
Granddad###There'll be time enough when you're older for felonies and jail.
Mae###What's a felony?
Granddad###A bad thing they put you in jail for.
Mae###Not if they don't catch me!
Granddad###Ok, how about a story before bedtime?
Mae###A Longest Night story!
Granddad###Sure!
Mae###But not a dumb one like Charity Bearity.
Granddad###How about a ghost story?
Mae###Oooooooh. Yeah.
Granddad###Alright then-
Mae###I hope lots of people die in it.
Granddad###Quiet, kid. I'm starting over here.
Granddad###Long ago, in the hills...
Mae###Why aren't I cold?
Gregg###Fire. We have a fire.
Angus###We have reached that level as a civilization.
Mae###Oh.
Mae###I'm booooooored. Feels like we've been here forever.
Bea###Oh! We should do the Longest Night constellation thing!
Mae###Wow. Really?
Gregg###I haven't done that since I was like 6.
Mae###No one has done that since they were like 6.
Bea###Well I don't remember being 6.
Mae###Really?
Gregg###Really?
Bea###Yeah I don't remember much before like 8 and a half.
Angus###That's very specific.
Gregg###Bea is a synthetic lifeform created at age 8.5.
Mae###This makes so much sense.
Mae###**Beep boop, Bea.**
Gregg###**ONE ONE ZERO ONE ONE ok whatever i'm done
Bea###Can we just do this thing?
Gregg###None of us knows enough about the constellations to even do it, BEA.
Mae###Yeah, BEA.
Angus###I do.
Gregg###Since when?
Angus###Since always.
Angus###Now listen up dummies, we're going to school.
Bea###Space school!
Bea###I can't see anything.
Angus###We're pattern-finders. Find some patterns!
Angus###Well, that's all 13 of them.
Bea###Yay! Thanks Angus!
Mae###That was pretty great!
Gregg###You're a big 'ol nerd, Cap'n.
Angus###Yes.
Angus###Yes I am.
Gregg###You should be a professor.
Angus###I like to think I fill that role at the video store.
Bea###Well, I should probably get home.
Mae###Wait.
Mae###I just realized that I haven't hung out with you in years, Bea.
Bea###What?
Not Stated###Yeah, not since like 7th grade?
Not Stated###We had a huge fight when we were 12!
Bea###I remember. I was there. You were a massive jerk.
Mae###But why am I at a Longest Night bonfire with you?
Bea###Because you just missed me so much.
Bea###I remember it more like you stopped sitting with me at lunch
Bea###or returning my phone calls
Bea###or responding to messages.
Bea###Always with Gregg, too cool for me.
Gregg###Sorry, Bea. Didn't mean to be a friendship wrecker.
Bea###It's cool, Gregg, it was ages ago.
Mae###Wait. Are we actually in space?
Angus###...
Mae###But I'm warm. And breathing?
Mae###What am I sitting on?
Angus###Tyrannosaurus pattern.
Mae###What?
Mae###Oh god... I haven't seen Gregg or Angus for a year and a half.
Gregg###Regret and emptiness!
Mae###I didn't go home for Longest Night.
Bea###Laundry day!
Gregg###Apple juice taste from when you threw up earlier.
Bea###You have to call home.
Gregg###You don't want to call home.
Angus###It's too late to take the bus.
Bea###What made you think of me today?
Gregg###You don't want to take the bus. This is your new life.
Bea###Is it still new after a year and a half?
Angus###Underwear adjust!
Gregg###Next year will be new again.
Bea###Next you will be new again.
Angus###Leg stretch!
Mae###Oh COME ON, this is getting stupid. Am I seriously
Mae###Well, home's not gonna call itself...
Angus###Harmonium, the head of the singing orders of angels.
Bea###Ugh. This one.
Bea###My mom always said I looked like this one.
Mae###I can see it!
Bea###I sure can't.
Mae###Leading so many cranky angels
Bea###...
Mae###grouching hard
Bea###...
Mae###across the sky.
Bea###ok.
Angus###Mooooooving on...
Angus###Marmanodes, the little king.
Angus###He was... um... a king who was little?
Angus###I don't know anything about this one.
Bea###Apparently a little king was big news back then.
Bea###I don't think he was even supposed to be all that small.
Angus###"Stop the presses!"
Bea###"So there's this king, right?"
Bea###"But get this- he's slightly smaller than you'd expect."
Angus###"He wears small shoes! Let's immortalize him in the night sky!"
Mae###I'm kinda short!
Gregg###Mae Borowski: Constellation.
Bea###Naw.
Bea###Everyone who picked the constellations is dead now.
Angus###Tollmetron.
Angus###It rings at the end of the world
Angus###and Mundy shakes everything off her back
Angus###and I think it all catches fire too.
Gregg###It all made sense back then.
Mae###Back when people were like wicked dumb.
Bea###Yeah I don't mean to sound like a jerk but people were super dumb back then.
Angus###It's all relative.
Mae###And full of dumb people.
Angus###Beautiful, dumb people.
Angus###Rubello, Pope sometime in the 1400s. Crazy times.
Bea###Oh god I love this one.
Angus###There were two rival popes
Angus###and Rubello won by opening his mouth
Angus###and consuming them with fire.
Angus###and then he ate them.
Mae###WHAT
Bea###BWAAAAAAAAAH
Gregg###I knew that one!
Mae###That is amazing.
Angus###I mean historically his extended family poisoned one
Angus###and stabbed the other before throwing him into a canal
Bea###But he did eat them.
Angus###He did eat them, yes.
Mae###That is the raddest thing I have ever heard.
Bea###CHOMP CHOMP whoops I ate you. Now I'm the pope.
Angus###The Broken Snake, the first thing that talked.
Bea###This story has always made me so annoyed.
Mae###I was totally the kid in sunday school who pitched a fit over this story.
Bea###Oh my god I remember that!
Bea###You got sent out to adult church to sit with your parents!
Mae###No punch and cookies for me!
Gregg###Wow I certainly missed out on all of that.
Angus###Oh dude, you didn't even.
Angus###Corvin, The Thief.
Angus###Stole the diamond from the crown of Rubello, the fire-breathing pope.
Angus###Got arrowed to death like 200 feet from the palace.
Mae###So he didn't get to be a constellation for being a great thief, then.
Bea###He did not.
Gregg###Screw the man. Steal their diamonds.
ALL###Screw the man.
Bea###Ah yes, the revolutionary zeal of kids from the suburbs.
Mae###Possum Springs isn't the suburbs!
Angus###Yeah you need a city to have suburbs.
Mae###We're in the dead center of nowhere.
Mae###It's like a 40 minute drive if you want to buy shoes.
Angus###Also I'm 21! I'm not a kid! I think you're younger than me!
Gregg###I'm 21 too. We both have full time jobs.
Angus###Well, as close to full time as they can get
Angus###before they have to start giving us health insurance.
Mae###I'll be 20 in like 4 months!
Bea###Ok FINE. You're all very serious adults.
Angus###Thank you.
Gregg###Yes, thank you.
Angus###Harmonium, the head of the singing orders of angels.
Bea###Nice of them to throw us a bone.
Bea###A really condescending, boring bone.
Angus###Yeah, moving on...
Angus###Lucio!
Gregg###Aw yeah!
Not Stated###Who?
Not Stated###What?
Angus###A Fish.
Mae###...and?
Angus###Just a fish. Pretty self explanatory.
Bea###Huh.
Angus###Fun fact: Fish is my sign.
Not Stated###I think that means you're adaptable and smelly.
Not Stated###I think that means you're a failure in all things.
Angus###Invenerus, the inventor of music.
Bea###Nice beak. Reminds me of Germ.
Angus###Ha ha.
Gregg###Germ isn't even musical. Like at all.
Not Stated###Who?
Not Stated###Germ?
Angus###Um... Quinona. Executed by some king somewhere.
Angus###Her head continued to speak against her murderers for years.
Mae###That's pretty sweet.
Bea###Ugh. You'd think, right?
Bea###But in the story she's portrayed as annoying.
Bea###like she was being a martyr
Bea###about literally being martyred.
Bea###They eventually put her head in a trunk and threw it in a river.
Not Stated###Geez!
Not Stated###What did she do?
Angus###Ibon, the first singer.
Bea###Ever see the opera based on this?
Not Stated###No?
Not Stated###Oh yeah!
Angus###The Mice Writers, inventors of written language.
Bea###Weren't there supposed to be thousands of them?
Mae###Listen, there's only so much sky.
Gregg###The Mice Writers are my sign.
Not Stated###I think that means you're thousands of geniuses.
Not Stated###I think that means you're screwed.
Angus###Mundy, the world fish. Back then they thought whales were fish.
Angus###And you know, that the world was on one.
Mae###Mundy is my sign.
Bea###Oh god.
Bea###Of course it is.
Mae###Hey! What does that mean?
Gregg###Uuuuuuhm! Wuuuuuuuuhm!
Mae###Well if any of this meant anything
Mae###then it might mean something but it doesn't so
Mae###...it doesn't.
Gregg###Uuuuuuuhm? Wuuuuuuuuuhm?
Bea###Uuuuuhmmhm!!! Wuuuuuumhmhmhm!
Mae###What are you doing?
Gregg###Whale noises.
Gregg###Lucio! The fox!
Gregg###They had to spear him to the ground to keep him down!
Mae###Wait, keep him down? How so?
Gregg###You know, in general!
Gregg###Lucio the fox!
Angus###Scourge of the french countryside!
Gregg###Yeah, totally french. Totally a scourge.
Mae###Why does he have a spear through him?
Gregg###The candle that burns twice as bright gets speared through the guts!
Angus###Beautiful.
Angus###You can see why this one is so popular.
Gregg###Got one of those right, huh Cap'n?
Angus###Got a manly musk going here.
Gregg###You smell like that stuff I got you, *FINALLY*.
Gregg###Ice Hawk. It has a picture of an ice hawk on it.
Angus###I smell quite masculine.
Gregg###Like an ice hawk.
Bea###I think you smell nice, Angus.
Angus###thanks
Mae###What's an ice hawk?
Angus###...
Angus###...
Gregg###Aw Cap, you're not even.
Mae###oh my god you're actually sad i didn't mean anything i'm sorry don't cry angus!
Bea###Angus, you're really nice and smart and stuff.
Gregg###Don't listen to Mae. She's perpetually angry.
Mae###Ok I'm sorry I'll leave.
Mae###Why can't I leave? And how am I not freezing?
Angus###It's ok Mae. Just had a long year is all.
Gregg###Aw dude, it'll be better next year.
Mae###Go Angus! I'm on Team Angus!
Gregg###Me too! I'm team captain and designated makeout partner!
Bea###Me too! But not the makeout part. I'm... team treasurer?
Angus###Can I be the mascot?
Gregg###What? Germ! Germ that hangs out! Germ!
Bea###Where is Germ?
Gregg###Doing god knows what with whatever weird family he has.
Bea###I imagine him secretly being some kind of trickster wizard...
Bea###...who has assumed baffling form.
Mae###I have no idea who you're talking about.
Gregg###Oh no, Mae has Space Sickness! It took away her memory!
Angus###Eject her from the airlock!
Bea###Seriously Mae. He's Germ. You know Germ.
Mae###Wait, are we in space? Why aren't I cold?
Mae###Like Germ? Weird Germ?
Gregg###...yes?
Mae###How do you know...
Bea###I think Mae's getting sleepy.
Bea###I know, right?
Bea###Talked. Out loud. In public.
Mae###Oh is that all?
Bea###That was enough apparently!
Angus###Supposedly if you put your head underwater in some river in Italy
Angus###she'll tell you about her murder.
Angus###They renamed it the River Of Guilt.
Bea###But not like the guilt of her murderers
Bea###more like she's giving you a guilt trip or something stupid.
Mae###This constellation is garbage.
Bea###Chop my head off, I'll bite yours off!
Gregg###Happy Longest Night, everyone!
Angus###Moooooving on...
Bea###Oh it's brilliant.
Bea###It's like 21 hours long
Bea###and like 100 years ago when it was playing in Bright Harbor
Bea###the stage exploded during the part where Ibon crashes his balloon into the Wyrld Wyrm.
Gregg###Sweeeeeet.
Mae###Was anyone killed?
Bea###Like a lot of people!
Angus###Oh.
Bea###Listen, if you can't laugh at that, I have bad news about the rest of history.
Mae###We watched it when Mr. Olmers was out sick those two weeks.
Mae###It's like super long!
Bea###There's an awesome part where Ibon drinks the ocean to make the fish cry,
Bea###so he can finally hear their voices and teach them to sing.
Gregg###That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Bea###Yeah but it's the good kind of dumb.
Bea###Opera is kinda like that all over.
Gregg###What?!
Mae###Mice are nature's snack cake.
Mae###If you follow the food chain all the way down
Mae###you will find mice.
Mae###I'm sorry, Greggory, but your days are numbered.
Gregg###No way, man. I'm forever!
Gregg###Accurate.
Lori###Hey killer.
Mae###Geez! Who are you?

Mae###WE FOUND AN ARM ON THE GROUND TODAY!
Dad###Are we still pretending it's yesterday?
Mae###No! We came out of the Clik Clak and there was an arm!

Mae###Hey, the parents.
Mom###I made tacos.
Dad###Excuse me, WE made tacos.
Mae###Tacos?
Mom###Tacos!
Dad###Do you want Tacos?
Not Stated###I want tacos. Every day. All day.
Not Stated###No, I'm gonna snack it up at the party later.
Dad###The family that tacos together rockos together.
Mae###...
Mom###Honey no.
Dad###What?
Mae###I am so angry right now.
Dad###You’ve all turned against me.
Mom###Mae honey do you want sour cream on your taco?
Mae###I.
Mae###Want.
Mae###Everything.
Dad###Did you mean snake it up?
Mom###Watch out for snakes, honey.
Mae###Guys there's gonna be a fire and people.
Mae###Snakes will be running in terror.
Dad###Snakes don't run, kitten.
Mom###Can you imagine snakes with legs?
Mom###*shiver*
Mae###Those are lizards, mom.
Mom###Watch out for lizards then.
Dad###They'll getcha.
Mae###Great-grandad's clock.
Mae###It's from the old country!
Mae###It's never really worked.
Mae###There are a few things hanging around in here from the Old Country.
Mae###This clock, the trunk in the storage room
Mae###and whatever is buried under the house after the cement incident.
Mae###This thing goes off randomly every month or so.
Mae###Little wooden duck pops out. Makes the weirdest sound.
Mae###Scares dad half to death every time.
Mae###Used to joke it was Grandad getting even with him from beyond the grave.
Mae###Don't need the bathroom at the moment.
Mae###Tooth-brushing is for kissers.
Mae###I hate walking downstairs and finding out someone is in there.
Mae###I feel like I've stomped all over their right to privacy.
Mae###I will use the bathroom when I feel like it.
Mae###Which is not now.
Mae###I think I've only been in mom and dad's room like once.
Mae###Wait. That can't be right.
Mae###What do I even remember about it?
Mae###They have that creepy statue of naked people kissing
Mae###on the table at the foot of the bed.
Mae###NOPE
Mae###My mom got a cedar chest from her mom.
Mae###Some kind of heirloom.
Mae###I think back in the old days you were supposed to fill it with a dowry?
Mae###What is a dowry?
Mae###I'll just leave mom and dad's room to the imagination a bit longer.
Mom###...Mae?
Mae###Yeah?
Mom###Are you going to go out?
Mae###Yeah!
Mom###[wave]Come back to the kitchen for a second!
Mae###Hey dadders.
Dad###Why if it isn’t the Mayor of Possum Springs herself.
Dad###What did you get up to today?
Mae###Hung out with Angus a bit. You remember him?
Dad###Oh yeah! I like Angus. He’s smart.
Dad###In the old days I used to work with his dad.
Dad###I know they fell on some hard times after we all got laid off.
Dad###Used to see him at the bar…
Mae###Yeah.
Dad###After I stopped drinking I didn’t really see him as much.
Dad###I wonder how he is.
Dad###Did they find out anything about that arm?
Mae###Not that I heard.
Dad###huh. Well, be careful out there.
Mae###Maybe I should carry mace or brass knuckles or something.
Dad###Well it’d be a shame if you got into trouble
Dad###and were unarmed.
Mae###Naw, I think I’ll be ok.
Dad###...
Mae###What?
Dad###...
Mae###HA HA HA HA HA ok I get it.
Dad###UN-ARMED??? EH??
Mae###I’m going to bed now.
Dad###Goodnight Mayor Kitten.
Mae###Goodnight!
Mae###If I don't get out of this room I am probably going [speed=.7][color=999]to burn it down with me in it.
Mae###I bet someone has done that. For like [color=999]political reasons.
Mae###I wonder what would be left if I did [speed=.7][color=999]burn the room down with me in it?
Mae###Bones probably. Copper pipes. [speed=.7][color=999]A shrieking phantom.
Mae###"Yeah, this is a good location"
Mae###"but I hear there was once a house here and a girl burned it down."
Mae###"[speed=.5][color=999]With her inside it.[/all]"
Mae###"We like to mention that to potential buyers."
Mae###"There is a lot of screaming."
Mae###"[speed=.7][color=999]I mean was."
Mae###In fact, she did it on a night [speed=.7][color=999]JUST LIKE TONIGHT...
Mae###And that's why I should [wave]go outside.
Mae###
Dad###You're on the couch!
Mae###Hey Dad, would you mind moving the boxes in the crawlspace?
Dad###Well what have you done for me lately?
None###Been an excellent daughter.
None###Been a credit to this family.
Dad###That doesn't count.
Dad###Well would you watch some TV with me?
Mae###Um... what about those boxes I asked about? In the crawlspace?
Dad###Hmm. I'm thinking about it.
Dad###Watch some TV with me?
Mae###So how about those crawlspace boxes?
Dad###Yeah, okay. I'll move 'em.
Dad###TV time?
Dad###You staying up?
Not Stated###Yeah for a little bit.
Not Stated###Nah, I'm heading to bed.

Mae###Aw yes.
Dad###Sounds like a plan.
Mae###How's work?
Dad###Ya know. Better than the glass factory!
Mae###Is it?
Dad###I've mined, I've ran machines,
Dad###but now I get to slice steaks
Dad###and hock salamis.
Dad###I mean, it's easier on the back that's for sure.
Mae###But like, do you like it?
Dad###I like havin' a paycheck!
Mae###Fair.
Dad###Paychecks: the sweetest meats of all.
Dad###What'd you do tonight?
Mae###Oh ya know. Stuff.

Dad###Slang you could pick up at work.
Mae###ok yes point made
Dad###Oof.
Mae###What's up?
Dad###Long day.
Mae###Yeah, same here.
Dad###How's socializing?
Mae###Surprisingly tiring sometimes.
Dad###Yeah. That's why I don't do much of it!
Dad###Pleasant surprise seeing you at work tonight
Mae###Yeah! I can't believe I hadn't visited yet.
Dad###Well you haven't been back long.
Dad###And you're not usually lurking at the Ham Panther.
Mae###Who's to say I'm not?
Dad###Well it was nice seeing you anyway.
Mae###Lurk lurk.
Mae###Any idea what was up with mom today?
Dad###Oh, she's just stressed.
Mae###You seem a little stressed tonight.
Dad###Yeeeep. A bit stressed.
Mae###Stressed about...
Dad###Oh, just stuff.
Mae###That's vague.
Dad###Ha ha, well.
Dad###I hate to be the one to break it to you
Dad###but you spend a lot of adulthood being vaguely stressed.
Mae###Aw dang.
Mae###I thought the stress would at least get more specific.
Dad###Oh no you'll have that too.

TV###These days things are pretty cushy!
TV###You think we’re getting soft?
TV###You sure are… AROUND THE MIDSECTION
TV###“that’s a whoppah!”
TV###Malloy, it’s company policy to never body-shame!
TV###oh, i never worry about that, Garbo.

TV###I’m what you call bodyshameless!
TV###Coming up next: Garbo and I go to counseling!

TV###“ok so we all think there’s a god, right?”

Mae###Yeah. Dad put 'em here i bet.
Mae###dad should move 'em.

Mae###If I don't get out of this room I am probably going [speed=.7][color=999]to burn it down with me in it.
Mae###I bet someone has done that. For like [color=999]political reasons.[/all]-_-
Mae###o_o
Mae###I wonder what would be left if I did [speed=.7][color=999]burn the room down with me in it?[/all]o_o
Mae###Bones probably. Copper pipes. [speed=.7][color=999]A shrieking phantom.
Mae###"Yeah, this is a good location"

Mae###This shall not stand.
Mae###OK ok ok.
Mae###It’s go time.
Mae###Ugh I should probably make sure I don’t look like a cave beast.
Bea###there you go.
Mae###I'm sorry, Bea. I’m a mess.
Bea###You know? Whatever.
Bea###It’s not your fault.
Bea###You're just a kid.
Mae###I'm older than you! Two months!
Bea###Yeah well,
Bea###I stayed here and got older
Bea###while you went off and stayed the same.
Mae###zzz
Bea###*sigh*
Bea###G’night Mayday.
Mae###Let's see if this Angus fix works...
Mae###can't get any worse at least.
Mae###i guess it could be on fire?
Mae###anyway.
Mae###Oh good.
Mae###I was right.
Mae###I look like utter hell.
Mae###BURN IT!
Mae###=_=
Mae###Well
Mae###that was a weird one.
Mae###I feel awful.

Mae###With me in it.
Mae###Live out my remaining days as a shrieking ghost.
Mae###Yup.
Mae###:|
Mae###Urg.
Mae###Um, that was pretty much perfect.
Mae###Not bad considering I don't know how to play this song!
Mae###I don't even know how to play this song. Why am I doing this.
Mae###Well...
Mae###Yeah, that wasn't good.
Mae###Ouch.
Mae###I literally do not know this song.
Mae###I remember the time in 9th grade
Mae###when I snuck out and could see into Tom Bramwell's bedroom.
Mae###:\
Mae###Yep that sure did happen. :|
Mae###I could jump down on Mr. Twigmeyer from here.
Mae###It would easily kill him.
Mae###I hold your life in my hands, Twigmeyer.
Penderson###Wait, what are you doing...
Penderson###[shake=.04]Hey! You [color=aaaaaa]kid!

Penderson###AND YOU TELL YOUR FOX FRIEND I KNOW WHAT HE DID.
Mae###You mean Gregg?
Mae###What's your problem with Gregg?
Penderson###DIRTY FOX STOLE MY GARDEN GNOME!!!
Penderson###I saw his fancy little leather jacket and his dainty little boots disappear through the hedge.
Penderson###Everybody knows about him.
Mae###Everyone loves Gregg. Gregg's the bomb.[/speed]=_= o>
Penderson###You tell him I'm calling the cops.
Penderson###And I'll do the same for you if I see you up on the powerlines again!

Not Stated###Sure is!
Not Stated###Nope!
Twigmeyer###You home for a visit?
Mae###No, I'm home for good!
Twigmeyer###What, they not have college anymore?
Not Stated###Nope. It burned down
Not Stated###Not for me at least.
Twigmeyer###I always thought you'd either go on to do great things
Twigmeyer###or sit on your ass here until it put down roots.
Mae###Ass roots?
Twigmeyer###Guess I can settle that one in my mind.
Mae###...
Mae###...see you around...
Twigmeyer###Well I'm sure you burned it down.
Mae###These allegations, Mr. Twigmeyer.
Twigmeyer###I ain't allegatin'
Twigmeyer###Just try not to burn my lawn down, you firebug.
Mae###No promises.
Twigmeyer###Well it looks like Mae.
Twigmeyer###Bet it smells like Mae.
Mae###I have a smell?
Twigmeyer###When you were a kid,
Twigmeyer###Susan used to call you a little dirtball.
Not Stated###Well I was a dirtball.
Not Stated###I was never a dirtball.
Twigmeyer###You still are a dirtball I bet.
Mae###Cradle to grave. 100 percent dirtball.
Twigmeyer###That's the spirit!
Mae###See you around, Mr. Twigmeyer!
Twigmeyer###Aw Mae, you were our dirtball.
Mae###Every child's dream.
Twigmeyer###See? Count your every blessing.
Mae###Well, you can *COUNT* on seeing me around tomorrow.
Twigmeyer###Feel free to rake my lawn.
Mae###You paying?
Twigmeyer###Get out of here, dirtball.
Mae###Well it sure is fall.
Mae###All the roadwork crammed in before winter.
Mae###Makes like half the town inaccessible.
Mae###Unless you wanna walk the long way around
Mae###for like 20 minutes.
Mae###Which, I mean, no.
Mae###Hey Mr. Twigmeyer!
Twigmeyer###
Mae###Alright then!
Mae###Rake 'em good, Mr. Twigmeyer!
Penderson###HEY! YOU KID!

Mae###Yes, Mr. Penderson.
Penderson###Didn’t last long, eh?
Mae###No, Mr. Penderson
Penderson###You get a job yet?
Not Stated###I’ve only been back for like 24 hours.
Not Stated###Yes. I’ve been elected mayor.
Penderson###Soon it'll be "only a week"
Penderson###then a month
Penderson###then your whole life.
Mae###You're right. I have so much time left. =_= :)
Mae###o_o :|
Penderson###Hhmph. Couldn't do worse than the current one.
Mae###And I've ordered your house to be bulldozed.
Penderson###What, finishing the job you started?
Mae###I hope you enjoy living in the woods!
Penderson###Those eggs took the paint off the vinyl siding.
Mae###Scavenge food! Commune with the beasts, Mr. Penderson!
Penderson###Watch yourself, lil miss.
Mae###"Lil. Effing. Miss?"
Penderson###No one's forgotten who you are and what you did, you know.
Penderson###They may act like they have.
Penderson###But that's just small town polite right there.
Mae###Is that what this is?
Penderson###Small town polite's all you got kid.
Penderson###So watch it.
Mae###Well that was really interesting
Mae###but I need to go listen to my cells die.
Penderson###PAH!
Mae###PAH!
Penderson###...freeloadin' trash mammals...
Molly###Hey Mae.
Mae###What?
Molly###I was just stopping by to see how you were doing.
Mae###Why?
Molly###After the other night I mean.
Mae###Why wouldn’t I be fine?
Molly###Mae, a lot of things that happen around here,
Molly###sometimes in town, sometimes out by the tracks,
Molly###sometimes up in the hills...
Molly###...
Mae###What?
Molly###It's my job to make sure folks like you
Molly###never see something like what you saw the other night.
Not Stated###You’re not doing a very good job of it.
Not Stated###"Folks like you"?
Molly###Better than you might think.
Mae###I’ve been back less than 3 days and I already saw dead body parts.
Mae###Which wasn't a big deal, but
Molly###You didn't see Tom Jennings shoot his brother in the stomach
Molly###last night out on Doty Line Road. Out past Arner.
Molly###You didn't have to walk out into that cornfield.
Mae###Geez.
Molly###You're a kid, Mae.
Molly###And you're naive.
Molly###And in its own stupid way, that's beautiful.
Molly###But the world isn't.
Molly###And the world isn’t out there somewhere.
Molly###It's here.
Mae###Alright, are you gonna arrest me or something?
Mae###Because I have a party to go to.
Molly###Watch yourself, Mae.
Molly###I'd really hate to see something happen to you.
Molly###And being in the wrong place at the wrong time is all it takes.
Mae###...
Molly###That's all I'm saying.
Mae###That's ominous.
Molly###Good night, Mae.
Harley1###Kill Kill Kill!
Harley3###FBI freeze!
Mae###Nah, not feelin' the graveyard today.
Mae###I feel like you might need Bea for the full graveyard experience.
Mae###That was not a joke about her mother.
Mae###=_=
Mae###oh god.
Mae###what do *YOU* want?
Molly###hello to you too, mae.
Mae###well?
Molly###I wanted to let you know.
Molly###we ran a test on that arm you guys found a few days back.
Mae###o_o
Mae###oh really???
Molly###yeah. thought you'd be interested is all.
Mae###definitely!
Molly###arm belonged to a middle aged man
Molly###and medium build.
Molly###and he was dead when it was removed.
Mae###whoa.
Mae###that means...
Molly###it doesn't mean anything yet.
Molly###i just thought you'd like to know.
Molly###you always liked detective stories when you were a kid.
Mae###ok. yeah. thanks.
Mae###this ghost is seriously messed up.
Molly###ghost?
Molly###wasn't no ghost involved in this, whatever it was.
Mae###yeah yeah. nobody believes me. i get it.
Molly###be careful, mae.
Molly###strange stuff going on.
Mae###yeah you're telling me.
Molly###have a nice evening, mae.
Mae###I remember the time in 9th grade
Mae###when I snuck out and could see into Tom Bramwell's bedroom.
Mae###:\
Mae###Yep that sure did happen. :|
Mae###When the flood happened that one year this pole fell over
Mae###and I was scared it’d somehow electrify the water all over the neighborhood
Mae###and it’d stay that way
Mae###and I was kinda afraid of taking a shower
Mae###or turning on the faucet for weeks.
Mae###hey dad.
Mae###no work today?
Dad###i told bob to shove it.
Mae###:)
Mae###really?
Dad###no.
Mae###:|
Dad###…

Dad###yeah, i’ll be fine.
Dad###not gonna sugarcoat it. I hate my job.
Mae###aw dad. Why?

Dad###they fire you just for talking about it
Mae###is that legal?
Dad###legal don’t always matter.
Mae###is there anything you can do?
Dad###i mean, we *do* need a union
Dad###it’s just easier to say it than get it done
Dad###unions were always there in the mines and the factory
Dad###least for a while
Dad###but here…
Mae###i got something for ya
Mae###got it out of the basement
Dad###how’d you get in the basement?
Mae###door in the crawlspace

Mae###Hey Mr. Twigmeyer.
Twigmeyer###Hello.

Twigmeyer###Lawns are like people.

Twigmeyer###Ok.
Mae###Wait. How are lawns like people?
Twigmeyer###Gettin’ late in the year
Twigmeyer###and we ain’t gonna see each other much
Twigmeyer###so I’m out here putting in that good time.
Mae###Huh.
Mae###You have a pretty strong bond with your grass.
Twigmeyer###Heh heh well I grab hold of just about everything I can.
Mae###After the flood it laid in our yard for 2 weeks
Mae###like a big dead... thing.
Mae###But then they put it back up
Mae###and I could see it from my window at night
Mae###and it felt spooky for some reason.
Mae###Spooky pole.
Mae###Undead friend.
Mae###Watching me from the curb.
Penderson###Bah!
Mae###Bah! \o/
Mae###_o_

Molly###i’m working, mae.
Mae###=_=
Mae###suuuure.
Molly###*sigh*
Mae###what’s wrong
Molly###don’t ask. Lotta weird calls this morning.
Mae###o_o
None###oh.

Mae###_o_
Molly###be careful.
Molly###just... be careful.
Mae###well geez until now i never considered that!
Molly###MAE!
Mae###ok fine thanks bye
Mae###Whoever lives here is certainly a churchgoer.
Mae###Five saints.
Mae###Grandmama had a setup like this
Mae###last time I saw her.
Mae###"Icons are good for keeping the good in"
Mae###"and the bad out."
Mae###This is the super-important info I retained
Mae###from years of sunday school.
Mae###In the end Grandmama died, while the saints watched.
Mae###It was time.
Mae###And they weren't saints anyway.
Mae###They were pictures.
Mae###Pour one out for Grandmama.
Mae###Must be weird to sleep in this bed every night.
Mae###Alone in the building.
Mae###Except for Telezoft a couple floors down.
Mae###maybe they work there.
Mae###just come downstairs in their pajamas
Mae###hey everybody i just woke up and i live at work.
Mae###oh god this sounds horrible.
Mae###I could sleep in this bed.
Mae###and whoever lives here would never know.
Mae###they’d go to sleep
Mae###tonight
Mae###unaware someone else was just there
Mae###under their sheets
Mae###on their pillow.
Mae###mwa ha ha ha.
Mae###i could also like
Mae###be helpful
Mae###i could make their bed when they don’t.
Mae###this doesn’t have to be creepy.
Mae###I could hide in here until whoever lives here gets back.
Mae###And possibly give them a heart attack.
Mae###Or get shot in the face. With a gun.
Mae###What am I doing in here?
Mae###What am I doing with my life?
Mae###I'm sitting in a stranger's closet
Mae###in a nearly-vacant building.
Mae###I could just stay in here.
Mae###Just forever be here forever.
Mae###Where does this person pee?
Mae###It's dark in here.
Mae###what’s even in this closet?
Mae###i feel some shoes.
Mae###some shirts i think.
Mae###ok they’ve got a golf club or something
Mae###oh weird. They have a sword in here?
Mae###i could take the sword and rob a bank?
Mae###hands up, citizen! I’ll jam this sword in your neck!
Mae###ha ha. I could wear a mask and a cape.
Mae###“who was that dashing thief?
Mae###that threatened to stab the bank teller in the neck?”
Mae###Ugh. My life is a wreck.
Mae###I’d probably stab my *own* neck on accident.
Mae###get it together, Mae.
Mae###but seriously where does this person pee?
Mae###I wonder if whoever lives here knows I’ve been here.
Mae###I feel like we have some relationship
Mae###like I’m a ghost
Mae###and I’m haunting them.
Mae###I should like
Mae###Move something.
Mae###just to let them know someone cares
Mae###enough to visit them.
Mae###ok I’m not gonna do that.
Mae###that would be the creepiest thing ever.
Mae###After the parade got canned there wasn't much going on in the spring.
Mae###But we still did the easter basket blessing at the church.
Mae###And ate special pretzels. We didn't bother to bless those.
Mae###Profane pretzels.
Mae###Oh my god. These flowers are fake as hell.
Mae###Mallard deserves a better memorial.
Mae###Wow. So this is where this stuff ended up.
Mae###I remember the spring parade. It was so much fun.
Mae###Until the year that Mallard P. Bloomingro snapped his tether and ran over Chris Evans.
Mae###Then they canceled the parade.
Mae###Cowards.
Mae###They couldn't cage Mallard. Mallard needed to be free.
Mae###And neither ropes nor the poor legs of Chris Evans could hold him back.
Mae###I wonder what happened to both of them.
Mae###*Who lives here?*
Mae###It's, like, just a room.
Mae###One fridge.
Mae###One dresser.
Mae###One lamp.
Mae###One bed.
Mae###One window.
Mae###One door.
Mae###I guess that makes two ways out.
Mae###This would be creepy if it wasn't so spooky.
Mae###Tell Alec to fix the code.
Mae###seriously. There’s no bathroom in here.
Mae###and none outside this room.
Mae###do they poop in this dresser?!
Mae###oh god...
Mae###do they poop in a bucket?????
Mae###oh geez what if I stumble across the poop bucket.
Mae###there are unanswered questions here.
Mae###wonder if it’s a guy or a gal
Mae###they’re probably pretty old
Mae###no one young cares about the saints
Mae###or church.
Mae###gonna be weird in like 30 years
Mae###when all the churches are empty.
Mae###i’ll open a pizza place.
Mae###sit in the pews and eat pizza.
Mae###gotta come up with a pun
Mae###combining pizza and church.
Mae###Holy pepperoni!
Mae###\o/ :(
Mae###OH MY GOD!!
Mae###M A L L A R D ! ! !
Mae###WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOU?
Mae###_o_ :|
Mae###It's locked. What the hell.
Mae###That is a fire hazard.
Mae###No seriously, is this thing is clearly marked as something it is not.
Mae###I'm coming back for you, exit door.
Mae###And we're gonna have a little chat.
Mae###With my boot.
Mae###Worst exit. Easily.
Mae###I'll keep you a secret, Mallard.
Mae###But I'll visit. o/ :)
Mae###_o_ :|
Mae###Mallard P. Bloomingro.
Mae###One of my absolute favorite things when I was a kid.
Mae###Proudest of the spring parade floats.
Mae###Dude. This is a tomb.
Mae###This is Mallard's Tomb.
Mae###Oh Mallard.
Mae###Probably left here by the Possum Springs Chamber Of Commerce.
Mae###Forgotten!
Mae###But I found you.
Mae###And I know you're here.
Mae###And still a springtime terror.
Mae###Mallard, dear dead Mallard.
Mae###You were my favorite anything when I was a kid.
Mae###I ran to the spring parade to see you.
Mae###You were like a big beaky dinosaur.
Mae###Mallard, you're still...
Mae###amazing forever. :)
Mae###:|
Mae###plastic flowers are like
Mae###super depressing
Mae###for some reason.
Mae###dead flowers are less depressing than plastic ones.
Mae###what's gonna happen to all this?
Mae###i guess it's just gonna sit here
Mae###til someone gets around to throwing it all out?
Mae###i should like
Mae###steal the good stuff.
Mae###see what mom and dad think.
Mae###i'm sure they'll love it.
Mae###redecorate the living room!
Mae###Mrs. Miranda should meet whoever lives here.
Mae###They can talk fridges.
Mae###Wonder what’s in the fridge.
Mae###eh. That’s a violation of privacy.
Mae###i could like
Mae###see what’s in this dresser
Mae###Mae, is this what it’s come to?
Mae###you’re stealing from a stranger’s weird apartment?
Mae###what even are you doing with yourself.
Mae###and they probably don’t have anything good.
Mae###so there’s no excuse.
Mae###Hey Alec, you need to hide this interaction!
Mae###aw man!
Mae###it’s locked again!
Mae###this blows.
Mae###ugh.
Mae###i’m like personally offended
Mae###by whoever lives here.
Mae###whatever, whoever.
Mae###whatever.
Mae###hmm... locked
Mae###Gregg?
Mae###Hey, where are you?
Gregg###OVER HERE!!!
Gregg###Hey, you wanna shine that light down here?
Gregg###Cool thanks.
Gregg###omg what was that?
Mae###Nothing.
Gregg###uh huh
Gregg###Hey more light please
Gregg###wtf?
Gregg###ok. there's something up there.
Mae###told you
Gregg###Alright, let's finish this. Also watch my back. Basically do both.
Gregg###Hey! you up there!!!
Gregg###AW YEAH!
Gregg###FOUND THE BASEMENT DOORS!
Mae###THHH!!!
Gregg###What?
Mae###Thtop Yelling!
Gregg###Why are you talking like that?

Gregg###The one over there’s got famous disasters.
Mae###That’s the cool person’s desk.
Mae###The other person is boring.
Gregg###I wonder if they’re friends
Gregg###I mean, you can work with someone and not be friends.
Mae###Hm yeah.
Gregg###Maybe this room isn’t so boring after all.
Mae###No, it definitely is.
Mae###FOUND ONE!
Gregg###Alright so we got the stuff.
Gregg###Let’s get that elevator open and see what’s upstairs.
Mae###Gonna guess it’s like 12 more elevators
Mae###Well, that’s the easy part I guess.
Gregg###Yeah... pliers are gonna be a bit more tricky to find.
Mae###Hmm...
Mae###Well, let’s head back up.
Mae###gum!
Mae###notecards!

Mae###phone charger!

Gregg###OWL!
Mae###Are you ok?
Gregg###I think so.
Gregg###That was dangerous!
Mae###I didn’t know owls attacked like that!
Mae###What was his effing deal?
Mae###so we’re in the basement.
Gregg###What are we actually looking for, by the way?
Mae###The thing I read said that sometimes when someone stays late
Mae###They hear weird things.
Mae###In something called The Map Room
Mae###and in some off-limits area?
Gregg###Technically all of this is an off-limits area right now.
Mae###True, dude. True.
Gregg###Dude, is that like... two elevators?
Gregg###And not, like, old ones.
Gregg###Locked, too.
Mae###Geez. Maybe this place is all elevators.
Gregg###Weird. Why would you have two?
Mae###One for the ghosts, one for the normies.
Gregg###Private rooftop ghost party.
Mae###with a ghost pool.
Gregg###i hope you get squished by the elevator.
Mae###i hope your head gets stuck in the door
Mae###and gets chopped off.
Gregg###i hope you fall down an elevator shaft.
Mae###i hope you get trapped in a dark elevator
Mae###filled with water
Mae###and an angry shark.
Gregg###holy crap dude that's...
Gregg###*shivers*
Mae###“Closed For Insurance Purposes”
Gregg###“Caution: Stairs Not For Climbing”
Mae###“These Stairs Are Original To The House
Mae###And Are Not Functional At This Time.”
Gregg###What the hell are “nonfunctioning” stairs?
Mae###So are we just supposed to like...
Gregg###Levitate?
Mae###Huh.
Mae###Oh check it out.
Gregg###Elevator number 3
Mae###Looks like it’s not locked either.
Gregg###Elevators for miles, dude.
Mae###Yeah. This is weird.
Mae###Hey. It’s an elevator.
Gregg###Alright.
Mae###Yeah that’s definitely gonna be easier than the stairs.
Mae###are you gonna go?
Gregg###are *you* gonna go?
Mae###why do i have to go first?
Gregg###it’s your ghost!
Mae###ok fine
Gregg###...itsnotevenreal...
Mae###What?
Mae###Dude, r-
Mae###...
Gregg###What
Gregg###the hell
Gregg###was that?
Mae###I don’t know.
Mae###Is someone here?
Gregg###No! Lights off, doors locked, no cars outside!
Mae###ok so...
Gregg###Do you want to go back?
None###Do you have your knife?
Gregg###Yeah.
Mae###Ok.
Gregg###Wait, is the assumption that I’m gonna stab someone?!
Gregg###Is that the plan now?!
Mae###No, I mean just in case.
Mae###I mean,
None###No.
Mae###And anyway
Mae###the basement door locked behind us.
Gregg###Oh right. Crap.
Mae###Gonna have to find another way out too.
Gregg###Hold on, let me add that to the list
Gregg###Map Room, Forbidden Zone, Find A Way Out
Mae###This is complicated.
Gregg###Crimes.
Mae###Crimes.
Gregg###looks pretty empty
Mae###and dark
Gregg###hey, where’s the flashlight?
Mae###crap
Mae###I left it outside.
Gregg###Dude.
Mae###YOU WERE BEING ATTACKED BY AN OWL!!!!
Gregg###Alright well
Gregg###I can see ok
Mae###Me too. Let’s look around.
Mae###They have an elevator that goes from the basement to the attic
Mae###with no stops in between.
Mae###what the actual crap?
Gregg###quick, let’s find a way out
Gregg###I FOUND A WINDOW!
Gregg###I THINK THERE’S A FIRE ESCAPE!
Gregg###window doesn’t open, though...
Mae###Other people go on weird ghost hunting adventures
Mae###and they’re looking for, like, cool shit...
Mae###I guess I found an ancient skeleton body last night...
Gregg###yeah dude
Gregg###at least we haven’t met anyone dead yet
Gregg###Ok well
Mae###Yeah, let’s find a paperclip.
Mae###Holy crap, is that elevator number 4?
Gregg###How?
Gregg###Why?
Mae###Granddad would be complaining about local tax dollars right now.
Mae###Hey... it’s another elevator?
Gregg###Huh. Weird.
Mae###AAAGH.
Gregg###That is... not cool.
Mae###Maybe it’s like
Mae###someone left a phone here and that’s... uh
Gregg###probably that.
Mae###probably.
Gregg###probably.
Mae###Crimes.
Gregg###Crimes.
Gregg###You’re kidding me.
Mae###Elevator number 5.
Mae###They’ve uh...
Mae###They’ve got a lot of elevators in here.
Gregg###That’s really weird.
Gregg###Hm.
Gregg###Locked.
Mae###I think this is as high as we’re going without picking some locks, so
Gregg###AW, CRAP
Mae###You’re kidding me.
Gregg###Dropped the lockpick stuff out back.
Mae###You’re *KIDDING* me.
Gregg###I WAS BEING ATTACKED BY AN OWL!!!
Mae###Ok.
Mae###Sorry.
Mae###Can you like, improvise?
Gregg###Um. Need some pliers...
Gregg###and...
Gregg###you got a paperclip?
Mae###Uh, no. Who walking around on earth today is carrying a paperclip?
Mae###Hey! Bet that office has one!
Gregg###i bet they use paper and need to like
Gregg###clip that shit?
Mae###nice nice nice.
Gregg###Nobody.
Mae###so like, ok, just so I got this straight now...
Gregg###shoot
Mae###Map Room, Forbidden Zone, Find A Way Out, Find Pliers, Find Paperclip
Gregg###I think that’s it
Mae###THIS IS SO STUPID!!!
Mae###This is like work! This is all work!
Gregg###Did you hear that?
Mae###yeah...
Mae###didn’t sound like a person
Gregg###yeah. I don’t know what that was.
Mae###ok well, let’s hurry.
Mae###Holy shit are we in the basement?
Gregg###Oh ok.
Mae###oh hey! That’s where that elevator goes?
Gregg###this elevator.
Mae###holy crap, i didn’t even notice this when we came in?
Gregg###huh. There’s another one over there too.
Mae###yeah so...
Gregg###this doesn’t make a lot of sense
Mae###Maybe like
Mae###this elevator is for loading things for the map room?
Mae###and like... they use the other one to avoid the stairs...
Mae###but even then,
Gregg###Dude, none of this makes sense.
Gregg###It doesn’t look like whatever that is is following us down here.
Mae###“whatever?” not “whoever?”
Gregg###whoever
Mae###are you coming around on this ghost thing?
Gregg###ghosts don’t use elevators
Mae###why? So a ghost can walk up stairs or something
Mae###but elevators are out of the question?
Gregg###...
Gregg###so the question I have is
Gregg###where does that one go?
Mae###ok
Gregg###crimes?
Mae###crimes.
Mae###ok
Gregg###here we go
Mae###It’s locked!!!! Something locked it!!
Gregg###SomeONE.
Mae###We can go back upstairs?
Mae###Actually no, we’re just gonna get chased around in a circle
Mae###by whatever it is.
Gregg###Whoever it is.
Mae###DUDE.
Gregg###aaaaaaand...
Gregg###Got it!
Mae###We don’t know where this is gonna go.
Gregg###Got any better ideas?
Mae###DUDE. Clearly I don’t.
Mae###Stuck!
Mae###we are so screwed!
Gregg###i'm working i'm working!
Mae###Did you guys just move in?
Bea###10 months ago.
Mae###Why aren’t you unpacked?
None###Pretty cool record player.
Mae###:)
Mae###as far as record players go.
Bea###It was my mom’s.
Mae###:|
Mae###I don’t have any records.
Mae###I don’t get records.
Bea###My mom was into them.
Bea###Ha ha. They were retro when she was a my age.
Mae###They’re retro now.
Bea###That’s how retro works.
None###Your old room was like...
Bea###Bigger?
Mae###Messy. Really messy.
Bea###Eh. I was a slob when I was a kid.
Mae###Guess the boxes take care of that problem.
Bea###No, mom yelled it out of me.
Mae###:)
Mae###MOMS, amirite?
Bea###U are rite.
Mae###:|
Mae###So I’ve got a question.
Bea###Mmhmm.
None###What exactly does your dad *DO* at the store?
Bea###These days? Not much.
Bea###Uh. Some administrative stuff.
Bea###He hires the repair guys...
Bea###He sometimes goes out on jobs.
Bea###That’s kind of his whole area.
Bea###But that's about it.
None###Your dad’s kinda up and down, huh?
Bea###He has good days and bad days.
Bea###Often in the same day.
Mae###ha ha. Gregg's always been like that too.
Mae###just more... uh... zany about it.
Bea###well Gregg is probably bipolar
Mae###gee thanks, doctor bea.
Bea###whereas my dad is having a years-long breakdown.
Mae###You run the whole store now, right?
Bea###More or less.
Mae###Yeah but it’s still his name on everything.
Bea###Yep.
Mae###And meanwhile you’re running basically everything.
Bea###Yep.
Bea###And! And! working there every day too.
Bea###Yep.
Mae###I just think you shouldn’t.
Bea###Ok.
None###I just think you're like selling yourself out.
Bea###I’m sorry, what?
None###I would probably just quit.
Mae###or like, take over the store.
Mae###Like, you not doing anything about it just reinforces-
Bea###Is this really the road you want to go down with this?
None###I’m saying you should stand up for yourself or just like... quit!
Bea###"Quit"?
Bea###Really? Just quit.
Bea###You are seriously detached from reality.
None###I’m saying it’s not right that you just roll over and take it.
Bea###"Take it?"
Bea###"TAKE IT"?!?!?!
Mae###You’re doing all the work and he’s getting all the credit!
Bea###oh go to hell.
Mae###:(
None###WHAT?!
Bea###you heard me.
None###WHY?!
Bea###RAAAAAAGH.
Mae###what is your problem?
Bea###here's some reality for you:
Bea###You know Creek? Repair Guy Creek at the shop?
Mae###:|
None###No?
Bea###You’ve seen him.
Bea###Talks a lot. Worked for us since forever.
None###...yeah?
Bea###yeah you met him when we were kids.
Bea###When I was 15 he asked my dad if he could teach me how to drive.
Bea###And my dad said no, and then told me not to be alone with him.
None###What the?
Bea###Yeah. Exactly.
None###I don't follow.
Bea###he's a creep, Mae.
Bea###And you know what? HE still works for us.
Mae###:(
Mae###!!!
Mae###Why haven’t you fired him?!?!
Bea###I can't fire people!
Bea###And even if I could, he’s on the crew.
Bea###And frankly he’s our best guy. Practically heads up the repair team.
Bea###Since my dad’s barely doing anything!
Bea###And Creek’s got a family. And he needs the work.
None###That’s disgusting!
Mae###\o/
Mae###It’s not your responsibility to-
Bea###I KNOW!
Bea###DON’T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT?!
Mae###_o_
None###I’m gonna be sick.
Bea###YEAH! ME TOO!
Bea###I’M REALLY FAMILIAR WITH THAT FEELING.
Mae###:|
Mae###I’m just saying if you keep letting these dudes off the hook-
Bea###OFF THE HOOK?!
Mae###Like, you're stronger than this, Bea.
Mae###You're like... badass and shit.
Bea###Y-YOU...
Bea###"BADASS?"
Bea###MY MOM DYING WAS NOT VERY "BADASS."
Bea###ME SITTING IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW IS NOT VERY "BADASS."
Mae###ok sorry, i-
Bea###You are such a shithead, you know that?
Mae###:(
None###Aaaaargh!
Bea###"Aaaaargh?" "Aaaaargh" what?!
None###What the hell?
Bea###"uuughhuhuhg what the hell?!"
Bea###A lot of time folks can’t just "choose" to do
Bea###whatever it is you decree to be the right thing!
Bea###A lot of times people do the things they do
Bea###because they can’t do anything else!
Mae###:|
None###You ALWAYS have a choice.
Bea###says the child-woman with no job
Bea###no rent
Bea###no responsibilities
Bea###and no consequences for your stupid actions
None###You can ALWAYS choose.
Bea###choose what?
Bea###honestly. tell me.
Bea###what is my choice here?
None###you can just leave! i dunno!
Bea###I... I...
Bea###y-you
None###tell your dad you're not gonna take this!
Bea###tell him what????
Bea###what is your magic solution
Bea###that *I* need to do
Bea###I am seriously going to punch your goddamn lights out.
Mae###:(
Bea###You come in here and start telling me how *I’M* screwing things up?
Bea###You want to come in here and say
Bea###“oh yeah just ditch your dad,
Bea###who is both getting old
Bea###AND can barely get off the couch half the time?”
Bea###Oh, but "good dinner", Mae!
Bea###You want to come in here and say
Bea###"oh yeah just start this big drama
Bea###and make your life WAY more stressful?"
None###It’s just not right is what I’m saying!
Bea###Yeah. It isn’t. Nothing’s right.
Bea###The whole effing world isn’t right.
None###That is NOT what I’m saying!
Bea###Oh, what are you saying, then?
Mae###AAAARGH I don’t know anymore!
Bea###like gregg is probably off doing god knows what wacky shit right now
Bea###i'm here making dinner and doing payroll.
Bea###You know like *nothing* about my life.
Bea###You just know what I “should” do.
Bea###And you’re the last person I’d ask for advice.
Mae###:|
Mae###Ok ok I’m sorry.
Bea###Yeah, you’re sorry. Everyone's sorry.
Bea###But you don’t get it.
Mae###I thought we were having fun!
Mae###We went to the mall! We got stuck in a basement!
Bea###Yeah and that was ALL you did those days.
Bea###I’d worked a good 6 hours before you even woke up probably
Bea###and came home each night after you and I were done
Bea###to pay bills and figure out how we’re making next payroll
Bea###While dad slept on the couch.
Bea###This isn’t fun.
Bea###You’re just like the other night, but all the time.
Bea###Running around messing with people and taking whatever you want.
Bea###While the whole mall is falling apart around you.
Mae###I thought you had a good time!
Bea###...
Bea###It’s like last night
Bea###you get to play around in garbage and break shit and everything works out.
Bea###While I’m stuck in the corner fixing the furnace.

Gregg###You know Steve Scriggins?
Mae###:|
None###The guy who locked that substitute teacher in the supply closet?
Gregg###Ha ha. Yeah.
Mae###Dude, he was stuck in there over Longest Night break.
Mae###Survived by eating glue and Spanish workbooks.
Mae###*Steve Scriggins* gave you this?
None###The guy who drove little circles around people in the school parking lot
Mae###so they were trapped?
Mae###Called it "Car Camp?"
Mae###And he’d blast one of those air horns at you?
Gregg###Yeah that guy.
Mae###He’s horrible, man. =_= :\
Gregg###BUT! He’s been hanging out at the Food Donkey since it’s been shut down
Gregg###and he dug it out for me.
Mae###That is the first useful thing Steve has ever done. :)
Mae###Oh wow you moved that onto the couch yourself?
Gregg###yep!
Mae###AFTER the stairs last night?
Gregg###I’m very impressive.
Mae###ok ok ok ok ok what do we do??? o_o
Gregg###We need to get this old battery into that old thing.
Mae###OK well this sounds straightforward enough. :|
Gregg###Kinda. It’s full of garbage.
Mae###it's too bad you didn't cut yourself on it and get a disease.
Gregg###it's too bad you didn't die on the way here.
Mae###it's too bad the robot wasn't filled with angry snakes  :) =_=
Mae###and they killed you.
Gregg###it's too bad the elevator didn't fall
Gregg###and squash you like a pancake. :)
Mae###oh dude no that's a phobia. :| o_o
Gregg###that's one that makes sense at least. :|
Mae###what were we doing again?
Mae###Geez.
Mae###That looks safe.
Gregg###Are you gonna be all boring now
Gregg###just because you died for like
Gregg###a whole 5 seconds?
Mae###Dude. =_=
Mae###Come on.
Gregg###Some people have been dead, like, FOREVER!
Gregg###Do you see them whining?

Mae###Are you saying I should... become a ghost? o_o
Gregg###Yeah! Carpy Diem!
None###carp-ay diem

MaeLaptop###we all did.
MaeLaptop###and i guess that's really scary? Like who knows what's gonna happen?
MaeLaptop###but i guess you can like connect things
MaeLaptop###or connect to things.
MaeLaptop###sometimes you need someone to be the thing you don't have
MaeLaptop###even if it's something you're supposed to already have.
MaeLaptop###All of you are what kept me from floating off tonight.
MaeLaptop###Also you kinda killed that guy to save me.
MaeLaptop###Don't think i didn't appreciate that.

Mae###i’m gonna drop over.
Gregg###yeah dude
Germ###sounds good!
None###Gonna like... Wander around the apartment.
Bea###don’t push yourself.
Mae###do you know why I beat down Andy Cullen 6 years ago?
Bea###no.
Bea###we weren’t talking then and I thought it’d be weird to bring it up now, and...
Mae###I was playing this video game. You were like dating ghosts or something.
Bea###ok
Mae###and I was really into it. Played it like 24-7.
Mae###until this one afternoon
Mae###and suddenly, like, something broke.
Bea###broke?
Mae###it was just like... pixels.
Mae###the characters onscreen… i felt like i knew them
Mae###they weren't /people/ anymore. They were just shapes.
Mae###and their lines were just things someone had written
Mae###they never existed, they never had feelings
Mae###they never would exist, either
Mae###and it felt so /sad/
Mae###like i’d just lost these real people
Mae###and this whole thing we had, it was just... me. Alone.
Mae###and like that realization like dumped out of the screen and into real life
Mae###went outside and the tree out front,
Mae###I looked at it every day, it was like a friend outside the window
Mae###now it was just a thing... just a thing that was there
Mae###growing and eating and just /being/ there
Mae###like all the stuff i felt about the tree
Mae###was just in my head
Mae###and there was some guy walking by
Mae###and he was just shapes
Mae###just like this moving bulk of... stuff
Mae###and I cried
Mae###because nothing was there for me anymore
Mae###it was all just stuff. Stuff in the universe
Mae###just... dead
Bea###wow... that's... huh
Mae###And the next day was that softball game
Mae###and Andy was the pitcher when I was up
Mae###and he was just shapes too
Mae###just lines someone wrote
Mae###like nothing in there
Mae###and I was so scared and angry and just... I dunno
Mae###before I knew it I was on top of him
Mae###smashing his face in with the bat
Mae###just shapes
Mae###red shapes all over the grass
Bea###oh my god, mae.
Bea###have you talked to anyone about this?
Mae###after it happened they made me go to therapy
Mae###with Dr. Hank-
Bea###oh gaaaaaaaawd. He’s the worst.
Mae###and he made me start a journal
Bea###a journal?
Mae###yeah he kinda just said it would help to be able to get my thoughts down
Bea###did it help?
Mae###kinda? sorta?
Mae###but since this whole thing happened, when I'm alone in a new place
Mae###it's all shapes, like back at the softball game
Mae###I was doing fine at college for a while
Mae###but I couldn't make friends, I was just afraid of being outside or around people alone.
Mae###And there was this statue of like the founder of something.
Mae###a really shitty statue, like all rusty metal,
Mae###and it was these shapes
Mae###and he was pointing down at me
Mae###and I was so... scared... I didn't leave my dorm room,
Mae###I either didn't eat or I ate entire pizzas at once
Mae###I downed cough syrup just to sleep all the time
Mae###and finally I got up the courage to leave.
Mae###and I came home. Where everything was fine.
Mae###where I knew everyone, and it wasn't just... dead shapes.
Mae###watching me.
Bea###Geez.
Mae###something broke. In my head. In my life.
Bea###i don’t mean to be like… whatever, but
Bea###it sounds like you’re suffering from some serious stuff
Bea###and like, I can help you find some help for it?
Mae###Dr. Hank already tried!
Bea###I think Dr. Hank should stick to family medicine and dentistry
Bea###and the half dozen other things he does
Bea###and maybe leave the mental health services to someone else.
Bea###like there are such things as depression and anxiety and like
Bea###i dunno… what you’re going through, it exists.
Mae###I… I thought when I came home…
Mae###i just-
Mae###i felt so safe here
Mae###and everything made sense for a few days
Mae###and then all this.
Mae###and… and… and…
Bea###shhhhhhh
Bea###it’s gonna be okay
Bea###we’ll figure this out
Mae###i’m so scared
Bea###i know. We’re all scared.
Bea###but we’re gonna make it.
Bea###you should get some sleep U_U
Mae###…
Mae###I-
Mae###…
Mae###…
Bea###zzz
Mae###…
Mae###hey.
Mae###hey gregg.
Mae###you awake?
Gregg###yeah.
Mae###do you know why I beat down Andy Cullen 6 years ago?
Gregg###back then you said you went all crazy
Gregg###but like that’s not really a reason i guess
Mae###i was playing that game where you like dated ghosts
Gregg###i remember that one. Had a hot skeleton.
Gregg###Allister or something like that.
Mae###heh heh yeah
Mae###you were crushing hard on those dank bones.
Mae###i was playing it like 24-7
Mae###until this one afternoon
Mae###and suddenly, like, something broke.
Mae###it was just like... pixels.
Gregg###your computer broke?
Mae###no like… reality broke.
Mae###the characters onscreen… like i’d felt like i knew them...
Mae###but they weren't /people/ anymore. They were just shapes.
Mae###and their lines were just things someone had written
Mae###they never existed, they never had feelings
Mae###they never would exist, either
Mae###and it felt so /sad/
Mae###like i’d just lost these real people

Mae###and he was just shapes
Mae###just like this moving bulk of... stuff
Mae###and I cried
Mae###because nothing was there for me anymore
Mae###it was all just stuff. Stuff in the universe
Mae###just... dead
Gregg###dude. Why didn’t you tell me?
Mae###i don’t know. What could i have said?
Mae###this all happened like the day before that softball game.
Gregg###i mean i was there in the stands.
Gregg###i watched you do it. I was so scared for you
Mae###when Andy stepped up it was like...
Mae###and he was just shapes too
Mae###just lines someone wrote
Mae###like nothing in there
Mae###and I was so scared and angry and just... I dunno
Mae###before I knew it I was on top of him
Mae###smashing his face in with the bat
Mae###just shapes
Mae###red shapes all over the grass
Gregg###there wasn’t *that* much blood
Mae###oh god. I made him bleed all over the place gregg
Mae###i wonder if he like wondered why
Mae###what he’d done
Gregg###he was probably an asshole
Mae###no, dude. I didn’t know him. Neither did you.
Gregg###well then you had to go to therapy
Mae###yeah Dr. Hank and his journalling.
Gregg###Dr. hank’s messed up one of my tooth fillings.
Mae###yeah he’s not good at what he does.
Mae###which i guess is understandable because he does like everything.
Gregg###i meant to ask you- did that journal shit… did it actually work?
Mae###kinda? Sorta?
Mae###it helps me… like… grab onto things. And keep them in one place.
Gregg###whoa.
Mae###but since that whole thing happened back then
Mae###when I'm alone in a new place
Mae###it's all shapes, like back at the softball game
Mae###I was doing fine at college for a while
Gregg###college is for losers.
Mae###dude. Listen, ok?
Gregg###sorry, dude.
Mae###I couldn't make friends, I was just afraid of being outside or around people alone.
Mae###And there was this statue of like the founder of something.
Mae###a really shitty statue, like all rusty metal,
Mae###and it was these shapes
Mae###and he was pointing down at me
Mae###and I was so... scared... I didn't leave my dorm room,
Mae###I either didn't eat or I ate entire pizzas at once
Mae###I downed cough syrup just to sleep all the time
Gregg###dude
Mae###and finally I got up the courage to leave.
Mae###and I came home. Where everything was fine.
Mae###where I knew everyone, and it wasn't just... dead shapes.
Mae###watching me.
Gregg###geez, dude.
Mae###something broke. In my head. In my life.
Gregg###Dude, you should have called me!
Gregg###we could have come and rescued you.
Gregg###woulda like kidnapped you
Mae###i like couldn’t call home either
Mae###i couldn’t even talk to anyone
Mae###i don’t even know why
Mae###i didn’t even come home for longest night
Mae###i just stayed in my room
Mae###in bed
Gregg###that’s… that’s horrible, dude
Mae###I… I thought when I came home…

Mae###i had this dream i barely remember

Mae###Bye, Germ
Adina###Hello?
CoffinWolf###Hello! Interested in a coffin?
Adina###Uh.
Not Stated###In the short term?
Not Stated###In the long run?
CoffinWolf###You never know!
CoffinWolf###These are hard times
CoffinWolf###and these woods will take your life.
Adina###You are the second person who lives here to tell me I'm going to die here.
Adina###You're still alive.
CoffinWolf###You can get out pretty easily, heading west.
CoffinWolf###The problem is getting through, to the east.
CoffinWolf###These are hard times. The days are short and the nights are long.
CoffinWolf###And the winter lasts forever.
Adina###Meaning?
CoffinWolf###Meaning you have a bright future in being a lump in a snowbank
Coffinwolf###if you keep heading east.
CoffinWolf###So head west. West is home.
Adina###Well, east is where I'm going, so...
CoffinWolf###The trees here move. They'll confuse your path.
CoffinWolf###They bend to the powers of the God of This Forest
Coffinwolf###and [speed=.5][shake=.02]The Huncher[/all] herself.
CoffinWolf###And you'll never obtain their permission to pass.
Adina###So this is why you're trying to sell me a coffin?
CoffinWolf###I provide a service- if you pay me now, I will collect your remains and bring them back to your relations.
Adina###You charge in advance for this?
CoffinWolf###I can't really charge any other time.
Adina###Oh. Right.
Adina###Well, I don't have any money.
CoffinWolf###Eh-eh. No coffin for you then.
CoffinWolf###And your ghost will be quite unhappy.
Adina###Whatever.
Adina###What'd you say about my ghost?
CoffinWolf###Those that die here, stay here. Their ghosts lie frozen until disturbed.
Adina###Oh.
CoffinWolf###All that's left of them are lumps in the snow and the things they brought with them
CoffinWolf###gathering frost.
CoffinWolf###Oh what those ghosts could tell us in these hard times.
Adina###Can I have a drink of something?
CoffinWolf###No.
CoffinWolf###You let the cold in every time you open the door, you know.
Mae###What did you say?
Granddad###Adina could see something up in the branches. Something that didn't belong.
Mae###She should climb up and get it and stop standing there like a lump.
Granddad###A lump?
Mae###Yeah she's lumping around and she should climb a tree.
Granddad###Adina wasn't much of a climber, so she had to improvise...
Mae###Was she LOST?
Granddad###She sure was! No matter how far she walked, she was never far from the forest's edge.
Mae###THAT'S WEIRD!
Granddad###These were no normal woods. These were magic woods.
Mae###That's dumb.
Granddad###These were the dangerous kind of magic woods.
Mae###Oh ok that sounds cool.
Mae###How did she get through???
Granddad###Well, maybe she needed some directions.
Mae###Aw but who from? She all alone.
Granddad###When you don't have any friends, you have to make them.
Granddad###That snow from the tree?
Granddad###It was special snow.
Mae###How do you figure?
Granddad###Well, if you knew just where to build it,
Granddad###you could make one hell of a snowman from that snow.
Mae###That's it? That's not special.
Granddad###You're a tough audience, kid.
Mae###JUST TELL A BETTER STORY!
Granddad###I could read you Charity Bearity Learns To Shareity again.
Mae###No, she is the woooooooorst!
Granddad###Ok, then, listen...
Snowman0###AAAAAAAAAAGH!
Adina###OH MY GOD!
Snowman0###WHAT AM I?!?!?!
Adina###WHAT'S HAPPENING???
Snowman0###WHAT AM I?!?!?!?!
Adina###HELP!!!
Adina###Are you ok?
Snowman0###what am i
Adina###You're a snowman?
Snowman0###i'm just water and garbage!
Adina###How are you talking?
Snowman0###i don't know what anything
Adina###You wouldn't happen to know how to find the Forest God, would you?
Snowman0###there's nothing about me that isn't forest and sky
Adina###That's like a poem.
Snowman0###WHAT AM I
Adina###You're like a poem!
Snowman0###AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Adina###So you're what, a ghost?
Snowman0###no ghost
Adina###Wait, you are no ghost or you have no ghost?
Snowman0###what am i
Adina###How's it going?
Snowman0###what is going
Adina###Ok then.
Mae###This snowman is no help!
Granddad###Well, if at first you don't succeed...
Mae###Kill it! And make a better one!
Granddad###Well ok, you got that partly right.
Mae###Which part?
Granddad###Listen up and I'll tell you...
CoffinWolf###Please leave. You've misused the oven.
CoffinWolf###Hello, can I interest you in a- WHAT IS THAT?
Not Stated###It's an arm. Goodbye now!
Not Stated###I need to borrow your stove...
CoffinWolf###Wait, what are you doing?
Adina###Putting this skeleton arm in your stove.
CoffinWolf###Um, no? No you're not!
Adina###Ssssh.
Adina###It is done.
CoffinWolf###That is [shake=.1]messed up.
Adina###You're telling me.
CoffinWolf###Please leave now.
Adina###Hello!
King###Ho there traveler!
Advisor###Hello!
Knight###Hrmphm
King###What is your business here tonight?
Not Stated###I'm going to the Frozen Lake
Not Stated###Not much, you?
Adina###So is this your land?
King###...
Advisor###...
Knight###...mrphrb phhrhvph...
Adina###I was just saying, because you're a king and all.
King###I may be a king.
Advisor###You may be!
King###But there are kings and there are gods.
Advisor###Yes yes.
Adina###Oh.
King###And as king I granted these lands to Baroness Lalopsey.
Advisor###And she sure did die!
King###Sure did!
Advisor###Lalopsey Manor's gone all weird now!
King###Sure has!
Advisor###Last spring travelers saw this pale thing come out of the bog there and-
King###Well, let's head out! Miles to go, men. Miles to go.
Adina###Oh ok. That's a good omen I'm sure.
Adina###...
Adina###Crap almighty.
Adina###Hey skeleton.
Adina###Well, I need an arm.
Adina###And that's an arm.
Adina###If I'm lucky, this skeleton is a criminal.
Adina###Was.
Adina###...
Adina###This used to be alive.
Adina###Now I just need to find a fire to stick it in.
Adina###OH GOD.
Adina###It's cold.
CoffinWolf###Goodbye!
Adina###Hello?
Snowacle###Hello.
Adina###Are you ok?
Snowacle###Well, just before now I was dead.
Snowacle###And I'm still dead. So there's that.
Adina###Oh. Sorry.
Snowacle###Maybe this means I can leave these woods...
Snowacle###and go wherever dead people go?
Adina###Is that how that works?
Snowacle###I think I was in some sort of a daze.
Snowacle###And this woke me up.
Adina###If you want to return the favor, I need some help.
Snowacle###I can tell your fortune, I can contact the dead...
Adina###I need to find the Forest God. I need to get through the woods.
Snowacle###Oh, well the first part's easy enough.
Snowacle###Find the shrine and say North's Canticle.
Not Stated###What is that?
Not Stated###I wasn't a churchgoer...
ShrineMouse###Pilgrim!
Adina###Hello, you!
ShrineMouse###I'm Father Patience Forget-Not-God.
Adina###WOW. That is a name.
ShrineMouse###It was gifted me when I was ordained.
Adina###What was your name before?
ShrineMouse###Butchie Mudd.
Adina###Ok, that's a change.
ShrineMouse###Do you wish to say a prayer at this
ShrineMouse###the shrine of Saint Orolony
ShrineMouse###who, beloved of the Forest God,
ShrineMouse###was shown the way to the chasm and the red bell
ShrineMouse###and into his holy mountain?
Adina###You said that all without taking a breath!
Adina###Who are you?
Adina###I mean, are you a ghost?
Snowacle###I don't know?
Adina###Who were you before?
Snowacle###I was a fortune teller, and a medium.
Adina###A real one?
Snowacle###Real enough.
Adina###See, I found this thing in a tree, and then I knew I had to build you here, somehow.
Snowacle###In seances we would often hold an object of importance to the deceased.
Adina###Did it work?
Snowacle###Well enough.
Snowacle###As for why here, well...
Snowacle###Sometimes a grave is the best place to contact the dead.
Adina###Oh god is this your grave?
Snowacle###Not mine. It appears to be someone's final resting place.
Adina###Who buries people way out here?
Snowacle###The snow.
Snowacle###Whoa, keep that away. I don't want to melt.
Snowacle###Alright, you've got a frozen arm.
Snowacle###From somewhere.
Snowacle###Or someone.
Snowacle###I'm not going to ask.
Adina###Now I have to set this arm on fire.
Snowacle###Thanks for the update.
Snowacle###Good luck!
Adina###Hey there... you ok?
Adina###I didn't have a chance to ask about you
Adina###and how you got here.
Snowacle###I think I'm gone...
Snowacle###I can hardly hear you...
Adina###Oh.
Snowacle###Yes.
Adina###Thank you so much.
Adina###You saved my life, fortune-teller.
Snowacle###I was a real one, you know.
Snowacle###it was real to me
Snowacle###even if
Snowacle###my sister, in the walls
Snowacle###...
Adina###Hello?
Adina###Goodbye.
Adina###Hm. I think I need something special for this one.
Adina###Otherwise I'm just bringing more screaming forest ice-babies into the world.
Adina###And that's no good.
Adina###Hey Sticky!
Snowman0###what is sticky
Adina###I named you Sticky.
Adina###Because of-
Snowman0###stick-y
Adina###-the sticks.
Snowman0###STICK-y.
Adina###yep.
Snowman0###why is stick-y
Snowman0###...
Adina###Are you gone already, Sticky?
Snowman0###...
Adina###I'm sorry, Sticky.
Snowacle###"In Their Wings, In Their Trees"
Snowacle###"All things die, Be at peace!"
Snowacle###"Cease all care, They are coming."
Snowacle###"God of The forest, carry us."
Adina###Where did you learn that?
Snowacle###We only said it in church twice a week
Snowacle###and also five times a day.
Snowacle###Didn't you?
Adina###I'm not from around here.
Snowacle###Once I wasn't either.
Snowacle###Listen, I still have some remnant of my sensitivities.
Adina###What?
Snowacle###If you're lost, I can try to point you in the right direction.
Adina###Thanks!
Snowacle###Oh you little heathen!
Snowacle###A girl after my own heart. Eh heh heh.
Adina###Do you know it?
Snowacle###"In Their Wings, In Their Trees"
Snowacle###"All things die, Be at peace!"
Snowacle###"Cease all care, They are coming."
Snowacle###"God of The forest, carry us."
Adina###And people say that?
Snowacle###Several times a day in this country.
Adina###Hm.
Snowacle###Listen, I still have some remnant of my sensitivities.
Adina###What?
Snowacle###If you're lost, I can try to point you in the right direction.
Adina###Thanks!
King###We're doing much!
Advisor###Come with us, we can do much!
Knight###...mrph phr phrmpt...
King###Right you are, Stevenson! She can't come with us!
Advisor###You're right! Ha ha ha ha!
Adina###Big plans, then?
King###We have our agenda for an audience with the Forest God!
Advisor###We have the [speed=.75][color=aaaaaa]severed arm of a criminal
Not Stated###What did you say you were going to set on fire?
Not Stated###Well, that sounds- WAIT, an arm?!
King###Well, that's a coincidence! So are we!
Advisor###Blessed meeting!
Adina###Do you know the way through the woods?
King###We surely do! We are bound for an audience with the Forest God!
Advisor###And after that we have an arm, [speed=.75][color=aaaaaa]and fire to light it!
Not Stated###What did you say you were going to set on fire?
Not Stated###Are you going to find The Hunch... wait, an arm? What?
King###The [speed=.75][color=aaaaaa]arm of a dead criminal!
Advisor###Donated, of course.
Knight###...hrmmphhr...
King###Ha ha ha!
Advisor###Oh Stevenson.
Adina###And you're going to [speed=.75][color=aaaaaa]set it on fire?
King###Yes!
Advisor###And it will light the way to the Huncher's Hollow!
Adina###Ugh this forest.
Adina###Well, best of luck!
King###Best of luck to everyone!
Advisor###Even you! We have enough luck to go around
CoffinWolf###Back to buy a coffin?
Adina###No, just getting warm.
CoffinWolf###I'm going to start charging for that.
Adina###If I don't have any money for a coffin
Adina###why would I have money standing by your stove?
CoffinWolf###I dunno, let's ask the free market.
Coffinwolf###There goes all of my heat again, right out the door.
Adina###Sorry.
ShrineMouse###Go in the peace of the God of the Forest, my child.
ShrineMouse###You may recite when ready.
Not Stated###Gracious Tree Lord, Leafy And Barked
Not Stated###Exalted Bear Enthroned Above
Not Stated###Enchanted Deer Monster, Hoofy In The Night
Adina###Um... hello?
TreeCat###'Evening.
Adina###Hey, didn't I see you before?
TreeCat###Hm?
Adina###Outside the forest?
TreeCat###No.
Adina###I think I did. But you didn't have a hat.
TreeCat###Couldn't be me. I do have a hat.
Adina###Hm.
Adina###Wasn't there a mouse here a minute ago?
TreeCat###Yep.
Adina###Did you eat it?
TreeCat###No. He just gave me his hat.
Adina###Oh.
Adina###Where is...
Adina###OH MY GOD.
Adina###YOU ATE FATHER PATIENCE FORGET-NOT-GOD?!
TreeCat###No. He left.
Adina###YOU'RE WEARING HIS LITTLE HAT!
TreeCat###He gave me his hat.
Adina###...
TreeCat###I feel so official.
Adina###I hate you.
Treecat###You got a prayer for me, Pilgrim?
Adina###Wait, why do you need to hear this?
TreeCat###It's not for me. It's for the shrine.
TreeCat###It's not for me or the mouse. It's for the shrine.
Adina###Hm.
TreeCat###Prrrrr.
Not Stated###"In Their Wings, In Their Trees"
Not Stated###Listen, do we have to do this?
ShrineMouse###My wandering child! Are you here to say a prayer?
Not Stated###Why yes, I am!
Not Stated###No, not right now
ShrineMouse###D...
ShrineMouse###Deer...
ShrineMouse###MONSTER?!?!?!
Adina###Ok I'll admit that one was a total guess.
ShrineMouse###You clearly have not known our Forest God.
Adina###Listen, I'm not from around here, and-
ShrineMouse###GO! Return when you have been granted knowledge.
ShrineMouse###BEAR?
Adina###I figured the forest god was maybe a giant bear?
ShrineMouse###The Forest God is no mere bear.
ShrineMouse###The Forest God is no bear at all.
Adina###Oh.
ShrineMouse###GO! Return when you have been granted knowledge.
ShrineMouse###The Forest God is no tree!!!!
Adina###I thought that, you know, because of the forest...
ShrineMouse###No tree can be a god!
Adina###I'm not following this line of logic.
Adina###So what *can* be a god?
ShrineMouse###Not a tree, obviously!
ShrineMouse###GO! Return when you have been granted knowledge.
ShrineMouse###You may recite when ready.
Not Stated###Wolf! Wolf! Thrice Wolf!
Not Stated###Sweetest Baby Moose, Oh Gentle Moose
Not Stated###Wooly Cat Of The North, Hear My Petition
ShrineMouse###Wolf? Wolf? Wolf?
Adina###Wrong?
ShrineMouse###Have you ever prayed before?
Adina###Kinda?
ShrineMouse###GO! Return when you have been granted knowledge.
ShrineMouse###I'm not sure where to even begin.
Adina###Please don't judge my personal faith.
ShrineMouse###GO! Return when you have been granted knowledge.
ShrineMouse###THE FOREST GOD IS NO FILTHY CAT!
Adina###Oh no?
ShrineMouse###GO! Return when you have been granted knowledge.
ShrineMouse###My child, have you learned yet how to pray?
Not Stated###...no...
Mae###So those snowthings are ghosts?
Granddad###Well, they have ghosts in them.
Mae###Are there ghosts?
Granddad###What do you think?
Mae###No, what do you think?
Granddad###Well, I think sometimes people stay with you long after they're gone.
Mae###Is grandma a ghost now?
Granddad###Ha ha ha. On the best days, yes.
Mae###I don't want you to ever be a ghost.
Granddad###Oh Mae, I'll be around to see your own kids.
Mae###No you won't.
Granddad###Well Mae, that's not a very nice thing to say.
Mae###No, I mean I don't ever want kids ever.
Mae###I want two big wooly barn cats and an old hound dog.
Mae###and we'll all howl at the moon!
Granddad###Never change, Mae.
TreeCat###Continue.
Not Stated###"All things die, Be at peace!"
Not Stated###Is the Forest God only God when I'm in the Forest?
TreeCat###You need to see the Forest God.
Adina###Yes.
TreeCat###This is how you see the Forest God.
TreeCat###Or try to, at least.
Adina###Try to?
TreeCat###That old thing doesn't see just anyone anymore.
TreeCat###Those days are gone.
Adina###So I just need to say the words?
TreeCat###No one knows what you mean, they just know what you say.
Adina###Fine, then.
Adina###"In Their Wings, In Their Trees"
TreeCat###This forest stretches from the hills below
TreeCat###over the mountains
TreeCat###and up to where they have to build a bonfire
TreeCat###to thaw the earth enough
TreeCat###to bury the dead.
Adina###Wow.
TreeCat###God of this forest is god enough.
Adina###Noted.
Adina###ok... um...
Adina###"All things die, Be at peace!"
TreeCat###Continue.
Not Stated###"Cease all care, They are coming."
Not Stated###Why are you helping me?
TreeCat###Continue.
Not Stated###"God of The forest, carry us."
Not Stated###Should I be feeling something?
TreeCat###Who says I'm helping you?
TreeCat###I'm just sitting here.
TreeCat###With my hat.
Adina###...
TreeCat###Go on?
Adina###"Cease all care, They are coming."
TreeCat###Very nice.
Treecat###Goodbye.
TreeCat###Something?
Adina###Like, is this gonna do something?
TreeCat###You don't feel a great sense of awe and wonder
TreeCat###and connection to something larger than yourself?
Adina###No.
TreeCat###Your loss.
Adina###I feel that when I look at the stars.
Adina###Back in the world, stars are kind of my job.
TreeCat###We're still in the world. Still the same stars too.
Adina###Ok, let's finish this.
TreeCat###Let's.
Adina###"God of The forest, carry us."
Snowman0###why is stick-y
King###Beautiful forest, don't you think?
Adina###Not to harp on this, and thank you again for your help,
Adina###but do you know whose body is under you?
Snowacle###No idea. I don't think it matters.
Snowacle###Just a connection to wherever.
Adina###Were you... um... somewhere else until now?
Snowacle###I don't know. I don't think so.
Snowacle###You don't even seem real.
Snowacle###This is like a waking dream.
Adina###This is weird.
Snowacle###Yes it is.
Adina###Ok, so I can't just take you apart, but
Adina###are you in pain?
Adina###You just seem so sad, Sticky.
Snowman0###i am nothing
Adina###See, I don't know how to interpret that?
Adina###Like, are you depressed or are you literally saying you are sticks and ice?
Snowman0###i am sticks and ice
Adina###...
Adina###Yeah, I still got nothing. I'll be back, Sticky!
Snowman0###stick-y... be back...
Adina###That's the spirit, Sticky!
Snowman0###stick-y-y-y-y
Adina###You sure are!
Adina###You're a fraud!
CoffinWolf###Why hello! Nice of you to stop by!
Adina###There are frozen dead people all over these woods!
Adina###I've talked to half a dozen of them tonight alone!
Adina###Either no one takes you up on this coffin business
Adina###Or you never follow through!
Adina###So which is it?!
Adina###Huh?!
CoffinWolf###You talked to ghosts?
Adina###Yeah! A whole bunch!
CoffinWolf###I think you got lost and cold and started talking to the snow.
Adina###No! I've been all the way from the Forest God's mountain
Adina###to [shake=.01][color=aaaaaa]The Huncher's Hollow[/all] for god's sake.
CoffinWolf###And yet here you are, back at my cabin, not more than an hour after you last left.
Adina###...
CoffinWolf###Letting the heat out and the cold in.
CoffinWolf###Busy night for you, eh?
Adina###Oh, go to hell.
CoffinWolf###Ha ha ha.
CoffinWolf###Hell's warm at least.
CoffinWolf###Goodnight.
ShrineMouse###You want to pray or not?
Not Stated###Why yes, I do!
Not Stated###No, not right now
Adina###"In Their Wings, In Their Trees"
Adina###"All things die, Be at peace!"
Adina###"Cease all care, They are coming."
Adina###"God of The forest, carry us."
Adina###Kid?
HuncherKidLW###She's gone.
HuncherKidLW###She just left.
Adina###Just now?
HuncherKidLW###All I know is that sometime after she left
HuncherKidLW###something happened.
HuncherKidLW###She stopped being what she was.
HuncherKidLW###I don't know if she died, or...
HuncherKidLW###but something is happening to me.
Adina###Can't you just go back home?
HuncherKidLW###Child, I am home.
Adina###Oh.
HuncherKidLW###But I am going to visit where I came from.
Adina###That's good!
HuncherKidLW###No. No, you don't understand.
HuncherKidLW###I used to hope no one who knew I was gone would come looking for me.
HuncherKidLW###But now I'm going to go looking for them.
HuncherKidLW###The townsfolk will weep when they see what I've done to them.
HuncherKidLW###And as they go into the ground, I will dig them up
HuncherKidLW###I will place them in the beds of those who loved them.
HuncherKidLW###And people will look at that ruin of a town
HuncherKidLW###and say it is haunted.
Adina###Oh, Kid, listen to me-
HuncherKidLW###Oh please, child.
HuncherKidLW###Until an hour ago I was younger than you. But now I am far, far older.
HuncherKidLW###You were kind to me, and I will give you this kindness in return:
HuncherKidLW###We won't meet again.
Adina###Hmm what's this?
Adina###Looks like a good spot for a snowman...
Snowacle###The trees here are weird.
Snowavle###Who knows what they've been into?
Snowacle###Look to the trees.
Adina###You said something about the trees?
Adina###Sometimes I don't see anything but snow up there.
Snowacle###Weird snow.
Adina###Weird snow?
Snowacle###Weird. Snow.
Adina###I'll check it out.
Snowacle###I have seen your future.
Snowacle###It lies hidden in the branches.
Adina###Ok. That's helpful.
Snowacle###Bless you my ch-
Snowacle###Oh. You were being sarcastic.
Snowacle###...
Adina###...
Coffinwolf###Hello. Might I interest you in a coffin?
Adina###No, I'm pretty sure I'll make it through the forest alive.
Coffinwolf###How nice!
Coffinwolf###In that case, get out!
Adina###Hey!
Snowacle###Hey, you! Still alive, eh?
Snowacle###I just saw all of the trees give a great shudder
Snowacle###like they were falling into line
Snowacle###and then you walked up.
Adina###I think the way is open to the Frozen Lake!
Adina###What do you think about that?
Snowacle###I think you should wrap up any business you have
Snowacle###and head east as quickly as possible!
Adina###Hm. What business would I still have?
Snowacle###I wouldn't pretend to know.
Snowacle###Hello
Adina###I'm looking for the Huncher?
Snowacle###I never found her.
Snowacle###and maybe that's a good thing.
Snowacle###she is not the forest god. she does not grant passage.
Snowacle###she is something altogether more... nihilist? Is that the word?
Adina###Huh.
Snowacle###She's an impulse playing itself out.
Snowacle###She isn't the first, and she won't be the last.
Adina###What?
Snowacle###Oh I don't know, child. I'm just talking.
Snowacle###You'll never find her hollow without something to help you
Snowacle###and I never found out what it was.
Adina###thanks anyway.
Snowacle###be careful. you're getting into something here.
Mae###This is a great story now.
Granddad###Oh, you like the spooky stuff, huh?
Mae###You know I do. I hate the other stuff.
Granddad###Well, the other stuff is important too. Hang in there.
Mae###OK I GUESS
Adina###I'm a bit nervous about the frozen lake.
Snowacle###Do you know the story?
Adina###Not really.
Snowacle###Of how the lake was so deep
Snowacle###it went down to the grave
Snowacle###and the dead came to the surface
Snowacle###and spoke with the living?
Snowacle###Of how it was so black
Snowacle###that it ate the moon's reflection?
Snowacle###And how the moon, being jealous,
Snowacle###convinced the sun to turn its back on the lake
Snowacle###so it would be forever frozen?
Snowacle###That is why the dead may be found beneath the ice.
Snowacle###For they can no longer leave those waters.
Adina###Did any of that happen?
Snowacle###You're the one going there.
Snowacle###You tell me.
Snowacle###So you're looking for a severed arm...
Adina###...yes.
Snowacle###And then you're going to have to light it on fire?
Adina###...yes.
Snowacle###I'm kind of glad that I'm completely unable to help you with that.
Adina###I'm going to go search for this arm now.
Snowacle###...
Snowacle###You're just stalling for time aren't you.
Adina###*sigh*
Snowacle###That arm ain't gonna sever itself!
Adina###Alright, alright!
Gregg###oh hey it's my neighborhood.
Mae###and the highway.
Mae###no ham panther, though.

Mae###that he does.
Mae###Augh it's alive!
Gregg###geez that thing's ugly.
Mae###Well this was the source of the noise I guess.
Gregg###Mystery solved.

Mae###oh yeah. hm.
Mae###i mean i'd vote for us getting a taco place first but
Mae###yeah we never got around to getting our own serial killer
Lori###you ever think about murdering someone?
Lori###like ok so
Lori###a few Longest Nights ago i went to Bright Harbor with my aunt and cousin
Lori###and we went on the subway
Lori###and like there's no railing down there above the tracks
Lori###and i had this sudden urge to like shove someone off it?
Lori###it was weird and i felt guilty about it for a long time
Lori###but like i didn't actually do it so
Lori###i mean is that normal?
Mae###i think that's pretty normal
Lori###i guess you actually *did* try to kill someone
None###that was different
Lori###how?
Mae###that was like... not planned
None###no i didn't
Lori###a lot of people think so
Mae###yeah well
Mae###a lot of people are really stupid
Mae###and i wasn't trying to kill him

Mae###on the way to serial killer-dom
Lori###sorry.
Mae###it's cool.
Lori###you know what I like?
Mae###tacos

Mae###weird
Lori###wonder if they knew
Lori###ok ok ok ok
Lori###let’s see what we got!
Lori###I come out here at night sometimes

None###That sounds dangerous
None###why?
Lori###I don’t know.
Lori###I feel excited and I can sleep
Lori###you ever have that
Lori###where you’re so excited you go to sleep?
None###Coffee makes me sleepy
Lori###ha ha. Wuss.

Lori###I don’t remember my dreams
Lori###sometimes I fall asleep for like 5 minutes
Lori###but sometimes it’s for like an hour
Mae###that’s some risky business there
Lori###I have weird thoughts
Lori###like sometimes I want to go sleep in the woods
Lori###or in the basement of an abandoned house during the day
Lori###and only come out at night
Lori###and be, like, a monster
Lori###and, like, beautiful.
None###I know the feeling
Mae###I want to eat people sometimes
Lori###Really???
Mae###Pretty much as soon as I meet anyone
Mae###I wonder what they taste like
Lori###I feel like the world is full of bad people
Lori###who would be good to eat
Mae###Mmmmmmmhmm.
None###Those are, like, really attainable dreams
Lori###oh ha ha
Lori###i’m not beautiful

Lori###i’m objectively gross
Mae###way less gross than I was
Lori###do you think?
Mae###guaranteed
Lori###ok ok ok ok
Lori###let’s see what we got
Angus###Mae, this is like, tampering with evidence.
Bea###Ugh. Am I going to have to start worrying

Bea###oh cool! That’s where his grave is!
Bea###I’m actually interested in that.
Mae###How could you NOT be interested?
Mae###This is like actual dangerous ghost stuff!

Bea###Oh. After The Softball Incident.
Mae###Yeah. Mostly just watched tv and did therapy.
Bea###Well it’s actually a pretty cool old house
Bea###Used to be owned by one of the mine owners or something?
Bea###Railroad? Mine? Steel Mill? Something like that?
Mae###An actual haunted house!

Mae###Mae Borowski: A Detective Of Ghosts
Bea###Alright alright let’s go.
None###Naw, let’s look at more stuff.
Mae###oh wow. this is gnarly.
Mae###and AWESOME.
Mae###ha ha ha ha.
Mae###oh my god.
Mae###Hmm, this is interesting but...
Bea###Yeah, not exactly about a "ghost."
Bea###No "ghost" to be found here.
Mae###The way you say "ghost" it sounds like you don't believe me.
Bea###...
Bea###This one?
Mae###No ghost!
Mae###No ghost here...
Bea###old, old stuff in here
Gregg###well, here we are
Mae###*cough cough*
Angus###Mae you ok? I have my inhaler!

Bea###i mean technically you’re not wrong.
Angus###is it like asthma?
Angus###that's how asthma is.
Mae###it's not asthma, big guy.
Mae###but thanks.
Gregg###Sssh!
Gregg###I heard something.
Gregg###down there.
Bea###you going to be ok, mae?
Mae###yeah. I’m alright.
Mae###we should be quiet.
Bea###yeah. gotta save up for the screaming later.
Mae###heh heh heh.
Gregg###yeah. We’ll be silent terrors...
Mae###we’ll be ghosts.
Angus###Door.
Mae###Door.
Bea###Tunnel.
Gregg###Whatever.
Mae###here we go
Bea###i have no idea what to even think about any of this
Mae###it’s just... horror?
Angus###that's not a word you get to use too often.
Mae###that’s all i’ve got left
Mae###like, everything else in my head is gone
Gregg###let’s get out of here, fast
Gregg###my brain is in pieces right now
Mae###it’s all just empty
Mae###everything’s empty
Mae###what are we going to do
Gregg###we’ll crack that one when we’re far away from here
Mae###I don’t know if I...
Angus###shhh
Angus###talk later
Mae###I know you’re in here.
Mae###Say something.
HeadMiner###Well how about this:
HeadMiner###take a couple more steps forward if you wanna die.
Bea###show yourself!
Gregg###yeah asshole we’re like 5 times scarier than you
Eide###there they are! They’re right there!
Eide###I'm gonna kill them!
HeadMiner###Eide, you'll do no such thing.
HeadMiner###It's out of your hands now.
Eide###he... shot... me!
HeadMiner###Then I’d say we're even.
HeadMiner###Little girl got shot at the other night.
Miner1###Yeah. Sorry about that.
Mae###You're... apologizing?
Miner1###It was a bad call. I am sorry.
Mae###Uh. It's ok?
Mae###It didn’t actually hit me, so-
Mae###Wait. What the- Who are you?
HeadMiner###Buncha of old boys doing their damnedest
HeadMiner###to protect their own and their neighbors.
Mae###Th-... then. why are you trying to kill me?
Miner2###Kill you?!
Miner1###Nobody's gonna kill you!
HeadMiner###All of you are part of this town.
HeadMiner###by family relation or just by being hard workers.
Miner2###Contributors!
Mae###Um. ok.
Mae###so we could just leave?
HeadMiner###Well, *he* brought you down here for a reason
HeadMiner###and he’s not gonna let you leave until he’s had his say.
Mae###Well *he’s* already got an arrow through the shoulder.
Mae###I don’t think he’s gonna be having much say in whatever.
HeadMiner###…
Miner1###...
HeadMiner###Wait. So you think that Eide-
Mae###He kidnapped that kid at Harfest!
Mae###He’s… been in my head somehow!
Mae###I'm always tired! Constant headaches!
Mae###He's been following me... following all of us!
Mae###He-
HeadMiner###Oh, little girl.
HeadMiner###You don’t know what this is, do you?
Mae###What?
Mae###oh god
Mae###i’ve seen this
Mae###or I’ve… I’ve felt it…
HeadMiner###Was Ed Skudder and Jim Dorney who found it.
HeadMiner###20 years back or so.
HeadMiner###After the west mine closed out past Briddle
HeadMiner###Vest Schumacher. Last supervisor.
HeadMiner###was out there when the company locked off the entrance
HeadMiner###carved his initials and date in the door.
HeadMiner###Then you got this mine, the Old One.
HeadMiner###not even a proper mine. Big hole. Copper.
HeadMiner###Abandoned, shoot, long before any of us were born.
HeadMiner###too close to water.
HeadMiner###And that water was poison
HeadMiner###when the first settlers came out here.
HeadMiner###that old spring used to be right above where we’re standin’.
HeadMiner###but that water dried up.
HeadMiner###1992 or so some men from west mine
HeadMiner###come back up here to try bootleggin,
HeadMiner###practically built a new elevator, got the main tunnel cleared
HeadMiner###never found no coal, just dug deeper n' deeper
HeadMiner###til Ed busts through that wall and finds this place
HeadMiner###and Jim walks right into that hole
HeadMiner###and never hits bottom.
HeadMiner###Ed calls down to Jim
HeadMiner###Jim don’t answer
HeadMiner###but someone else does.
HeadMiner###I know you heard that voice, girl.
HeadMiner###In dreams and in waking times.
HeadMiner###‘swhat brought you down here.
None###what... what is it?
HeadMiner###black goat
HeadMiner###not even black like the color
HeadMiner###black like the space between the stars
HeadMiner###he’s down there, in that hole
HeadMiner###looking up at us right now
HeadMiner###he don’t talk to ya
HeadMiner###he... sings...
Mae###why would you just do something a hole in a cave told you to?
None###so what does this have to do with you, or me, or anyone?
HeadMiner###you got to understand
HeadMiner###in those days it was the end of the world
HeadMiner###jobs gone. Our kids were leaving.
HeadMiner###government didn’t care, only wanted our votes.
HeadMiner###just puttin in more regulations, sendin our jobs overseas,
HeadMiner###spendin our taxes on lazy people 'n immigrants
HeadMiner###while we worked ourselves to death.
Bea###ugh here we go.
Bea###goddamn i hate this crap.
Bea###you old dipshits.
HeadMiner###you finished?
Bea###yeah sure.
HeadMiner###we prayed and prayed up at the church,
HeadMiner###but when Ed Skudder came back down here and listened
HeadMiner###he got answers back.
None###oh god… i think i know...
HeadMiner###yeah he’s already in there singin to ya, right?
Mae###I… I…
None###answers?
HeadMiner###Ed explained it to a few folks, and they didn’t believe it
HeadMiner###but he was persuasive
HeadMiner###he had the glimmer.
Mae###"the glimmer?"
Miner2###ones 'e takes a shining to
Miner2###it rubs off on ya.
Miner2###you can do things.
HeadMiner###I never seen it
HeadMiner###but they said Ed could walk through walls.
Mae###ok.
HeadMiner###after Ed talked us into all this,
HeadMiner###after that first time, after we picked one out
HeadMiner###well...
HeadMiner###not only was the town holdin' stable
HeadMiner###but it was almost like we were getting younger, and money came too
HeadMiner###still a few of us left from back then
None###“Picked”?
HeadMiner###first one was Tom Turner, who believe you me was a bastard
HeadMiner###just pure trash
HeadMiner###we got him down here
HeadMiner###and in the hole he went.
HeadMiner###the next week, flowers bloomin’ all over the hills
None###“First time?”
HeadMiner###First one into the hole by our own hands.
HeadMiner###We own up to what we do. I was there.
Miner2###I was too.
Bea###You throw them in the hole?
Mae###...
Mae###they’re... feeding him...
HeadMiner###he's hungry like you wouldn't believe.
HeadMiner###every few months or so he starts singin’
HeadMiner###and it’s someone’s turn to find someone.
None###was that what you were doing the other night?
Miner1###No.
HeadMiner###What happened the other night was a shame.
HeadMiner###One of our number broke the rules.
HeadMiner###an' had to pay up.
HeadMiner###that was a hard thing to do
None###...
Mae###i think i’m gonna be sick...
HeadMiner###we never pick noone who’s gonna be missed
HeadMiner###that’s a solid rule.
HeadMiner###Drifters, drunks, and delinquents.
Mae###you’ve been… oh god… oh no...
None###How many people have died down here???
HeadMiner###oh, I’d say…
Miner1###3 dozen. Give or take.
Miner2###39.
Miner2###am I the only one keeping steady count?
HeadMiner###I do now. Early on I think we all wanted to forget.
Miner1###i still got a feelin' heart. it still hurts.
Miner2###yeah that dirtbag kid from the spring...
Gregg###C...c...casey?
None###Casey?
HeadMiner###The Hartley kid?
HeadMiner###all he was gonna contribute to society
HeadMiner###'cept a buncha kids growin up with no dad
HeadMiner###was a rap sheet a mile long
HeadMiner###before whatever sad end he’d wind up at.
HeadMiner###we did him a FAVOR.
Gregg###You... k-killed... Casey? :(
Angus###oh my god.
HeadMiner###we don’t use that word.
HeadMiner###you know he was taking up business with his cousin, right?
HeadMiner###you know what happened to his cousin?
HeadMiner###burned alive when his little trailer lab exploded
HeadMiner###they had to wear hazmat suits when they cleaned him up
HeadMiner###that’s where Casey was headed.
Gregg###You killed Casey.
HeadMiner###and you want to act like we didn’t do him and this whole town a favor?
Mae###oh god... Casey’s been down here the whole time.
Mae###his parents put up posters!
HeadMiner###maybe they shoulda cared more about him before it came to this.
Gregg###:|
Gregg###WHICH ONE OF YOU DID IT!!! D:
Bea###Gregg-
Gregg###HE WAS MY FRIEND!!!! D:
Miner1###Alright now. Throw it down right now or I will shoot.
Gregg###:)
Gregg###heh heh
Gregg###What if I get you first?
Gregg###bolt stickin' right outta your eye
Gregg###*bang*
Gregg###*baaaaaaaaang*
Gregg###:|
Angus###You brought guns down here?
Miner2###Dangerous this far out in the woods at night. Basic safety.
Gregg###I… I...
Miner1###Throw it down, son.
Miner1###Don’t make this our time.
Bea###Gregg…
Gregg###Dangit.
Mae###you’re monsters
Mae###none of this
Mae###none of this is happening
HeadMiner###we are not monsters
HeadMiner###We do it because we love our home.
HeadMiner###as long as we keep doing this,
HeadMiner###Possum Springs survives
HeadMiner###things *can* get better
HeadMiner###these mines are gonna be humming again someday
HeadMiner###old mills puffin’ smoke
HeadMiner###you kids don’t understand that-
HeadMiner###we lost what our world was built around
HeadMiner###used to be you provided for a family, bought a house
HeadMiner###now you’re stockin’ shelves at the grocery store
HeadMiner###kids leavin’ more than they’re stayin’... No opportunity here.
HeadMiner###old people dyin’, houses left empty
HeadMiner###you ever seen that?
HeadMiner###A *HOME* become a tumbled-in pile of wood and plaster?
HeadMiner###A *JOB* become a burned out brick box or a hole in the ground?
HeadMiner###but we can change that.
HeadMiner###we can put this place back together,
HeadMiner###where it won’t be just…
Mae###shapes.
Mae###i’m going to die down here
Mae###why are you telling us all this?
HeadMiner###Because we’re getting old
HeadMiner###and even with the fringe benefit of good health
HeadMiner###we need new blood
HeadMiner###to carry this on when we’re gone.
Bea###Really? You’re like, pitching us on this?
Bea###were any of you even miners back in the day?
Bea###any of you hurting now? financially, like?
Bea###or is this just some big costume party murder club
Bea###for someone's shitty boss who's afraid of dying?
HeadMiner###that don't matter.
Bea###*snort*
Bea###it does.
Angus###this is real bad.
Gregg###this is insane.
None###why should we help you?
None###why shouldn’t we just call the cops?
HeadMiner###And say... what?
HeadMiner###you saw some men you can’t identify
HeadMiner###in an abandoned mine behind a locked gate
HeadMiner###and an elevator that won’t run?
HeadMiner###that you saw a… hole?
Mae###ok fine. Why should we help you?
HeadMiner###because if no one is here to do this
HeadMiner###you remember that flood a few years back?
HeadMiner###you remember the blizzard of 2010?
HeadMiner###that’s what happens.
HeadMiner###and beyond that
HeadMiner###the jobs never come back. The kids never come back.
HeadMiner###everything crumbles. Possum Springs bleeds to death.
HeadMiner###and soon we’ll all be dead
HeadMiner###and this town will just be fields and trees.
Mae###I’ve... seen it.
HeadMiner###I know you have.
HeadMiner###I’ll understand if you need some time to think it over.
Bea###so we can leave?
HeadMiner###no one’s gonna stop you.
HeadMiner###but understand that you don’t know who we are
HeadMiner###out there
HeadMiner###but we know who you all are
Eide###ain’t fair they get to leave and I probably got permanent damage
HeadMiner###shut it, eide!
Eide###you don’t know a thing about what he wants! What he is!
HeadMiner###eide i swear to god
Bea###let’s go
Gregg###yeah let's seriously get out of here
HeadMiner###son, you leave that crossbow.
Gregg###what? why?
HeadMiner###well, i could bullshit you
HeadMiner###but the truth is i just don't trust you.
Gregg###fine whatever. It's a piece of shit anyway.
HeadMiner###heh heh.
Mae###I... I can’t move you guys
Angus###I’ll carry you.
Gregg###aaaaaaaaaw geez
Bea###what is this place?
Angus###looks like a church or something?
Bea###and like... junk...
Mae###oh god...
Mae###oh god...
Bea###what is it?
Mae###it’s here...
Mae###it’s here
Mae###oh god
Gregg###what is it?
Mae###i don’t know but it’s here
Mae###it’s... through there...
Angus###ok. well.
Bea###Angus! you saved us!
Angus###uh i mean i found fresh air.
Angus###it might just be a nicer place to starve to death.
Mae###dying anywhere other than in here is nice.
Bea###I just wanna die anywhere else
Mae###nice.
Gregg###nice.
Angus###nice.
Angus###looks like he took the elevator down.
Angus###so much for the element of surprise.
Angus###he’s gonna hear us coming a mile away.
Bea###we sure we want to do this?
Gregg###yeah mae, you sure?
Mae###guys, I don’t know if you understand...
Mae###*cough*
Mae###He's in my head.
Mae###I can't function like this.
Mae###everything is dying or dead already.
Mae###I... I don't know what's gonna happen down there...
Bea###ok then
Bea###we’ll come out of this together
Gregg###alright then.
Gregg###down we go together.
Mae###oof. That thing looks old.
Bea###they haven’t used this mine in like... a LOT of years
Bea###generations, even.
Gregg###are you our tour guide now?
Bea###we have Possum Springs tourism pamphlets at the shop
Bea###and i get bored.
Mae###*THIS* is in the brochure?
Bea###well this isn’t dangerous or anything
Mae###ha ha.
Mae###Nothing to be scared of down there. Just a party.
Bea###:)
Bea###heh heh.
Bea###not too late to throw ourselves into traffic instead.
Bea###:|
Gregg###geez. Spooky.
Mae###I don’t think we get to complain about spooky
Mae###we left our precious robot boy out in the woods. That’s spooky.
Gregg###:)
Gregg###nah dude. We created a legend.
Bea###what are you two even talking about?

Mae###you know
Mae###after I sent that kid to the hospital
Mae###years ago

Mae###but that’s not true.
Mae###I was angry because of something else.
Mae###something I’d lost
Mae###trying so hard since not to be angry
Mae###got me all defenseless
Mae###and i lost more, and more, and more...
Mae###that's not getting better
Mae###i want to be angry
Mae###when I ran home, from college,
Mae###on the bus I had this dream
Mae###or maybe I saw it out the window
Mae###last leaf on the tree
Mae###finally blown off
Mae###i'm so scared
Mae###all the time
Mae###and the fear *hurts*
Mae###feeling like everything is over
Mae###was over long before i got here
Mae###so long, hiding
Mae###or trying to outrun this.
Mae###i get it.
Mae###this won’t stop
Mae###until i die
Mae###but when i die
Mae###i want it to hurt
Mae###when my friends leave
Mae###when i have to let go
Mae###when this entire town is wiped off the map
Mae###i want it to hurt. Bad.
Mae###i want to lose
Mae###i want to get beaten up
Mae###i want to hold on
Mae###until I’m thrown off
Mae###and everything ends
Mae###and you know what?
Mae###until that happens
Mae###i want to hope again
Mae###and i want it to hurt.
Mae###because that means it meant something
Mae###it means i am... something, at least
Mae###heh heh ha haheheh heh
Mae###pretty amazing to be something, at least
Ibon###1837582
Mae###you know I can’t understand you, right?
Ibon###3487234
Mae###oh shut up already

Bea###i dunno, mae.
Mae###do you think you'd have the stomach for it?
Bea###nope.
Mae###it probably took a lot of heart.
Bea###yep.
Mae###i wish she would ex-spleen it to us
Bea###i get it, mae.
Mae###she really rectum!
Bea###ok that probably stayed in place
Mae###yeah that should stay where it be-lungs!
Bea###i'm leaving
Mae###hey, you gotta liver your life!
Bea###bye. this is me gone.
Mae###hey! wait up!
Bea###you're walking back to town
Mae###you've got a lot of gall to say that!
Bea###i'm calling the cops.
Mae###o>
Mae###Looking alright.
Not Stated###God, this shirt really accentuates my roundness, doesn't it?
Not Stated###I have the worst face. I have a nightmare face.
Mae###I think the round zero doesn’t help. _o_
Not Stated###It's cool, dude. Round is ok.
Not Stated###I need to stop eating literally everything I see.
Mae###Ugh don't do this to yourself, Mae. :\
Mae###Not tonight.
Mae###Tomorrow you'll do lots of situps :)
Mae###and learn to like horrible things like kale
Mae###and everything will be great.
Mae###<o>
Mae###I'm being body-positive like the internet said.  :)
Mae###I'm a real live person
Mae###_o_
Mae###and no one can prove I'm not. :|
Mae###Geez. What a mess. _o_
Not Stated###My big dumb eyes. My nightmare eyes.
Not Stated###My messed up ear. My nightmare ear.
Mae###Nightmare Eyes[/all] would be an excellent horror movie name. o_o :|
Mae###You’ll see the Nightmare Eyes outside your window.
Mae###and you'll know.
Mae###o_o
Mae###=_=
Mae###Oh yeah, well you should see the dog who did that.
Mae###Oh wait you can't, because he’s dead!
Mae###Because dogs don't live as long as people!
Mae###Put that in your pipe and smoke it, dog! \o/ o_o
Mae###with your skeleton lips!
Mae###o_o :| _o_
Mae###You can do this. People like you.
Not Stated###People don’t like you. Clearly.
Not Stated###You don’t like people. Clearly.
Mae###No friends at college!
Mae###Not even one.
Mae###Not really their fault. :\
Mae###Something's...
Mae###...
Mae###Whatever. =_= :|
Mae###Just because that online test said
Mae###that your best chance at being happy
Mae###is a situation where everyone already likes you
Mae###but they mostly leave you alone
Mae###except when they're delivering food to you...
Mae###that doesn't mean you can hide in your room
Mae###and wait for that to happen.
Mae###That's how hermits are made, Mae.
Mae###And they die alone in the middle of winter.
Mae###Waiting for pizza from friends they don't want to see.
Mae###Who cares if Cole is there?
Mae###Jerk. =_=
Not Stated###He’s probably up at school or whatever.
Not Stated###Prom was a mistake in like 10 different ways
Mae###Taking classes. Being all successful. o_o
Mae###Probably doesn’t even think about me.
Mae###Which is good because I honestly don’t care.
Mae###But I hope to any god who is listening that he isn’t there.
Mae###Please whatevergod.
Mae###Make sure Cole isn’t there tonight.
Mae###That dress.
Mae###That picture under that doorway flower thing.
Mae###Less slowdancing than slowstanding.
Mae###Careful nontouching. No smooches.
Mae###I'm so glad I'm not a teenager anymore.
Mae###My breath tastes like tacos.
Mae###This is a disaster.
Mae###Alright, what are you gonna say? o_o
Mae###You're a smooth talker. You're a smoothie. :)
Mae###o/
Not Stated###[wave]"Hi, I’m Mae! How's it going?"[/wave]
Not Stated###[wave]"Oh hey, I'm Mae! What's your name?"[/wave]
Not Stated###[wave]"Hi, I'm Mae! I dropped out of college earlier this week!"[/wave]
Mae###"Really? That's fascinating!"
Mae###"That is so true! Well, see you later!"
Mae###Ok good. That sounds normal. :| _o_
Mae###No one can prove you're not normal.
Mae###And really everyone looks normal in the dark.
Mae###I'm pretty sure that’s the only way sex works.
Mae###"Oh, I think I know you from somewhere..."
Mae###"It's probably from when we were lovers
Mae###and we beat up that street gang
Mae###with chains and garbage cans."
Mae###"And now I'm in the woods!
Mae###drinking!" \o/
Mae###_o_
Mae###geez this is yet another road to hermit-dom :\
Mae###=_= :( _o_
Mae###This is hopeless.
Mae###Wheel me out to the curb for garbage day.
Mae###Oh geez they’ll be here any minute! o_o :|
Mae###Good luck, kid.
Mae###I don’t need luck. =_= :)
Mae###I make my own luck.
Mae###With a luck machine. o_o :|

Mom###Mae honey?
Mae###Yeah?
Mom###Is everything ok?
Not Stated###Yeah!
Not Stated###What Do You Mean?
Mae###Yeah Mom, things are good.
Mom###Well I mean it was a bit alarming to your father and I when you called.
Mom###I assumed that something was very wrong.
Mae###No, it just didn't work out at school.
Mom###What does that mean, honey?
Mae###Can we talk about this another time?
Mom###Sure, hon.
Mae###Thanks, mom.
Mom###Honey, did something happen?
Mae###I just needed to come home.
Mom###Well sweetie I think you can understand my worry...
Mom###That's not usually something a college sophomore just up and does...
Mae###I know.
Mom###Honey, you can tell me if something happened.
Mae###Mom, I'm fine. Really.
Mae###Can we talk about this another time?
Mom###Sure, honey. It's ok.
Mae###Thanks, mom.
Mom###I betcha your old friends will be happy to see you!
Mae###You wouldn't happen to know where Gregg is, would you?
Mom###Oh yeah! Gregg's working down at the Snack Falcon
Mom###Up in Towne Centre West by the Clik Clak.
Not Stated###I think I'll run over and say hey.
Not Stated###We have a Snack Falcon now?
Mom###Oh yeah! It's so handy!
Mom###You know, ever since the Food Donkey went out.
Mae###The Food Donkey is gone?
Mom###Oh yeah! Going on almost a year now!
Mae###Wow. Where does everyone shop?
Mom###Everyone goes out to the Ham Panther out by the highway now.
Mom###But I see your little friend Gregg when I go into town.
Mae###Wow. The Food Donkey's gone. We have a Snack Falcon.
Mom###It's a whole new world, sweetie.
Mae###Yes it is.
Mom###Well, have a good time out there!
Mom###Lots to explore! See what's changed!
Mae###I will!
Mom###Just watch out for all the construction.
Mae###Well it wouldn't be fall in Possum Springs without loads of construction.
Mom###It's so festive, honey.
Mae###I'll be back later!
Mom###Bye, sweetie!
Mae###So what's been happening in town?
Mom###Well, let's see...
Mom###Did you hear Mrs. Crangler died?
Mae###Who?
Mom###You remember Mrs. Crangler! She taught your girl scout troop how to dance!
Mae###Oh wow. She was pretty old then, too.
Mom###Oh she was ancient, honey. She was ancient when I was your age.
Mae###How did she die?
Mom###From being ancient, honey.
Mae###How old was she?
Mom###115
Mae###WOW.
Mom###I know! If this were a contest, she'd have won!
Mom###Honey you've got to read this book when I'm done with it.
Mae###What is it?
Mom###Wellboy. It's a true story about a boy who grew up in a well.
Mom###His parents didn't want him so they threw him in a well.
Mom###And he was raised by eels.
Mom###In a well.
Mae###Wow.
Mom###Eels.
Mae###Eels.
Mom###Eeeeeels, honey.

Mae###spill it, mom.
None###what?
Mom###there was a big sinkhole 2 streets over!
Mae###oh, are we still getting those?
Mom###i don't think those ever really go away.
Mom###swampy ground and so forth. and on a flood plain.
Mae###oh weird.
Mom###i don't want you over there nosing around it.
Mae###i guarantee you i won't. I have seen sinkholes.
Mom###no interest at all?
Mae###mom they're just holes in the ground.
Mae###get back to me when one like swallows a house or something.
Mom###we'll go see together if that happens.
Mae###deal.
Mom###so what did you do last night?
Mae###Hung out with Gregg.
Mom###What did you do?
Mae###Uh. Went to the grocery store.

Mae###Went to the mall with Bea.
Mom###Oh! Fort lucenne?
Mae###yeah!
Mom###i haven't been there in years. How is it?
Mae###kinda falling apart and empty.
Mom###yeah i expect.

Mae###well, gotta go mom!
Mom###heh heh.
Mom###bye sweetie.
Mom###hm hm hmmmmmm.
Mom###You remember what happened to Suzie Kushner?
Mae###Geez, no mom! =_=
Mae###I've definitely never heard that story about 1000 times.
Mom###Do you remember what happened
Mom###when she wouldn't stay off the powerlines?
Mae###She got electrocuted.
Mom###Fried, darling. The newspaper said fried.
Mae###She made a full recovery, though!
Mom###Honey, she can't use adjectives now.
Mom###She lost an entire part of speech.
Mae###That's bad.
Mom###That's exactly the kind of sentence Suzie can't formulate.
Mom###So stay off the powerlines, ok?
Mae###Why was that again? o_o :)
Mom###Oh you are your mother's daughter alright.
Mae###:|
Mom###This book is about a boy who was raised by eels at the bottom of a well.
Mom###It's really full of misery and suffering and you need to read it after me, honey.
Mae###HI MOM.
Mom###So honey, I don't know what you're up to tonight, but if you're around at 9...
Not Stated###I might be?
Not Stated###Wait, what's that on the table? Is that...
Mom###Well there's a movie on tonight, Poison Husband: Toxic Vows.
Mae###What's it about?
Mom###Oh there's this woman, and she finds out she's being poisoned by her husband!
Mae###Oh geez! :(
Mom###And then her neighbor kidnaps her children and takes them to Canada!
Mae###Reasonable. :|
Mom###So the mom is searching for her kids across Canada and poisoning rotten men along the way.
Not Stated###Wait, what happened to the father?
Not Stated###Wow I might have to watch this.
Mom###Oh your father and I had Donut Wolf this morning.
Mae###You didn't save me any. :(
Mom###Honey, it's 4:30 PM. We're long past donut time.
Mae###This is a wound I will bear forever.-_-
Mom###I'm sure, sweetie
Mae###o_o :|
Mae###o_o :|
Mom###Listen honey, we need to talk...
Mom###You really do need to stop [hop]jumping[/hop] and climbing all over town.
Mae###Mom. I'm 20.
Mom###Mmmhmm.
Mom###Listen, most folks grow out of running around
Mom###on roofs and powerlines by now.
Mom###And your poor father is going to have to replace the mailbox again
Mom###if you keep jumping on it.
Mae###Mom.
Mom###Yes?
Mae###Mom.
Mom###What?
Mae###I'm 20.
Mom###Mmmhmm.
Mae###Well, see you later, mother!
Mom###Bye bye, daughter!
Mom###It sounds like it's going to depict a lot of human misery!
Mae###Ok I'll be back later. :)
Mom###It'll be a girl's night in!
Mae###:|
Mom###I think he's blind now from all the poisoning and is tailing her with a seeing eye dog.
Mae###Across Canada?? Is he riding the dog?
Mom###I think they ride the bus.
Not Stated###How do they know where she's going?
Not Stated###This sounds amazing.
Mom###Well I guess those dogs are just very intuitive!
Mom###And honey this guy has ingested a lot of poison
Mom###so they probably gave him a real good one.
Mae###The system works! :)
Mae###Morning mom.
Mom###Nope, I’m mom 24 hours a day.
Mae###Har har har.
Mom###Also it’s 4pm sweetie.
Mae###Well I’m off to find Angus.
Mom###Oh is he your little friend Gregg’s boyfriend?
Mom###Big guy? Kinda quiet?
Mae###Yeah that’s him.
Mae###I need him to fix my laptop.
Mom###Well he better, sweetie. You can’t afford to buy a new one!
Mae###Wait, do you even know Angus?
Mom###Do you?
Not Stated###Kinda?
Not Stated###Mom we are in a band together. Sorta.
Mom###Got a call from your Aunt Molly.
Mae###Ugh. What did aunt Mall Cop want?
Mom###Sweetie I really wish you wouldn’t call her that.
Mom###She worked very hard to get where she is
Mom###and it’s a dangerous job.
Mae###Oh yeah. Possum Springs is SOOO dangerous.
Mae###Anyway did she tell you about the severed arm we found?
Mom###She did, in fact!
Mom###Scary things.
Mae###Yeah I guess.
Mom###Honey, I know this is home
Mom###but please be careful out there.
Mae###I will, mom.
Mom###And come home before dark unless you’re with somebody
Mom###at least until they figure out what happened.
Mae###Ok.
Mom###Thanks, sweetie.
Mom###Well, no time like the present.
Mae###Thanks, 24 hour Mom.
Mom###7 days a week.
Mom###Oh, is the band back together?
Mae###Yeah! We practiced last night!
Mae###...I don't think we're ever gonna play though.
Mom###Hm.
Mom###Well, that sounds like fun, honey!
Mae###Yeah I guess.
Mom###You don't sound too happy about it.
Mae###eh.
Mae###Well, I'm off to find Angus!
Mom###Have a good time, daughter!
Mae###Thanks, 24 hour Mom.
Mom###7 days a week.
Mom###So honey.
Mae###Yeah?
Mom###*what did the arm look like?*
Mae###It was cut off like right above the elbow.
Mom###Was there blood and stuff?
Mae###Little bit, little bit.
Mom###I wonder who's arm it is.
Mae###Well, should be pretty easy to spot.
Mom###Yeah ha ha.
Mom###"Hey, what happened to your arm?"
Mom###"I dropped it by the diner!"
Mae###Here sir, I found your arm.
Mom###"Thanks, I was afraid I'd never see it again!"
Mae###People don't always return arms when they find them.
Mom###It's a real shame.
Mae###It's a cold world.
Mom###A cold, cold world, sweetie.
Mae###=_=
Mom###Hey hon! You look like crap!
Mae###Yup!
Mom###Rough night?
None###No, just tired.
Mom###OK, well take it easy...
Mae###I will.
None###Is it that obvious?
Mom###No, I was just saying you look like crap because I love you.
Mae###Thanks.
Mom###If you want to talk about it...
None###It's cool mom.
None###I saw Cole at a party in the woods.
Mom###From senior year?
Mae###Yeah he was home from school for the weekend.
Mom###Did you talk to him?
None###I don't really remember.
Mom###oh honey.
Mae###it's fine.
Mae###not... going to become a regular occurrence.
Mom###ok well that's good
Mae###=_=
Mae###Anyway.
None###Kind of. Sort of. I dunno.
Mom###Well, he's a jerk, hon.
Mae###No, he's not. Or he wasn't.
Mae###I dunno.
Mae###Anyway.
Mom###Looks like most of the repair workers have cleared out of Towne Centre.
Mae###FINALLY. o_o :)
Mom###Yeah, they're all done with the churchill steps
Mom###...and the powerlines...
Mae###Great!
Mom###Hon, I do *NOT* want you up on those things.
Mae###=_= :|
Mae###Mom, I'm 20.
Mom###Uh huh. Which means you go to jail for it.
None###No one is going to jail for running around on the powerlines.
Mom###It happens.
Mae###Yeah, if the cops have literally nothing else to do.
Mom###...
Mae###Ok good point.
Mae###:)
Mae###Aunt Molly would be so delighted to arrest me.
Mom###Heh heh. She might just.
None###Pssh. They'd never catch me.
Mom###Your Aunt Molly catches you up there
Mom###there's no telling what she'll do.
Mae###Did I tell you I saw her yesterday out front?
Mom###Really?
Mae###Yeah she was being all weird and cryptic.
Mae###I dunno. Everything's fuzzy today.
Mae###:|
Mom###And anyway it's dangerous.
Mom###You remember Susie Kushner?
Mae###Gee mom I sure don't.
Mae###I've definitely never heard this story 1000 times.
Mom###Fried, honey. The paper used the word FRIED.
Mom###Now she can't use adjectives.
Mom###She lost an entire part of speech!
Mae###Gee mom that's terrible.
Mom###See that's the exact kind of sentence Susie can't formulate.
Mae###...
Mom###So what are you up to today?
Mae###I dunno. Gonna go see what Gregg and Bea are up to.
Mom###You all gonna do something together?
Mae###I dunno. I don't think they hang out much
Mae###past messing around with our old band equipment.
Mom###Well, there are only so many hours and so many days in our lives.
Mae###Is there some bug going around that makes people talk like fortune cookies?
Mom###Friendships are like trees.
Mae###Uh huh
Mom###You have to water them so they grow.
Mom###And we each have only so much water.
Mae###Have you ever watered a tree?
Mom###No, god does that.
Mae###ok, I'm out.
Mom###See you later, sweetie!
Mae###o_o :|
Mae###Whatcha readin'?
Mom###Book about a guy who grew up secretly living on a fishing ship

Mae###How do you eat fishing line?
Mom###The crews thought the boat was haunted!
Mom###But nope. Just the Barrel Boy.
Mae###What's the book called?
Mom###Barrel Boy.
Mae###Oddly enough I now want fish sticks.

Mom###I wonder if Cole will be there?
Mom###I always thought you two were so cute together...

Mae###i could go for that today.
Mom###Hey hon.
Mae###o_o :|
Mae###Yeah?
Mom###Sorry about yesterday.
Mae###Me too.
Mae###I said some stuff
Mae###I didn't really mean it.
Mom###Well, whether you meant it or not
Mom###that isn't how we should communicate.
Mom###i don't want us to stop talking.

Mom###ok! Have a nice day, sweetie!
Mae###So what are you stressed about?
Mom###Well, I guess you're a grown up now.
Mae###=_=
Mae###just spill it, mom.
Mom###After your incident a few years back
Mae###o_o
Mom###as you know, we went into some debt smoothing that over.
Mae###geez. I'm still so sorry about that.
Mom###it's in the past. let's not go back over it.
Mae###ok
Mom###when it came time to get you off to school
Mom###we took advantage of a kinda of mortgage
Mom###to make sure you were taken care of.
Mae###O_o
Mae###ooooooook?
Mom###well turns out it wasn't a very good deal
Mom###and... i just feel so stupid...
Mom###they like to offer these mortgages to people
Mom###who maybe don't have a lot of money
Mom###and aren't used to getting offers like this.
Mae###:\
Mae###why?
Mom###because the bank took advantage of us.
Mom###and now they own the house, and we owe them more than it's worth.
Mae###what does that mean?
Mom###means we're not sure how long into the future we'll have the house.
Mae###O_O :|
Mae###holy crap we're in trouble, huh? And I'm a huge jerk?
Mae###o_o :|
Mom###it's ok, sweetie. don't worry.
Mae###what are you stressed about?
Mom###just budget. And bills. And stuff.
Mae###oh.
Mom###don't worry about it.
Mae###ok!
Mae###whatcha reading?
Mom###it’s a book of unsolvable murders.
Mae###did they all happen?
Mom###oh i don’t know. Maybe. Sure.
Mom###wanna hear a real teaser?
None###sure!
Mom###alright there’s a man lying dead in a kitchen
Mom###with a bullet wound in his head
Mom###there’s a man there with him.
Mom###he’s got some blood on his right hand
Mom###but no gun.
Mae###huh.
Mom###last thing- the dead guy has a scar on the back of his head.
Mae###do you know the answer?
Mom###well i don’t know if there’s *one* answer.
Mom###it’s supposed to get ya thinkin’
None###about murder?
Mom###can’t solve a murder without one!
None###you should have been a detective
Mom###yeah.
Mom###i woulda loved that.
Mae###ok so i have a question.
Mae###-_-
None###what kind of scar does the dead guy have?
Mom###“a straight line, a few inches across, hidden under the hair”
Mae###hmmm.
None###who’s the other guy in the room?
Mom###“the suspect is clearly upper middle class”
Mae###that’s not super helpful.
Mom###maybe he like ski tripped him to death somehow.
Mae###yeah he whacked him in the jacuzzi in his backyard.
None###what else is in the room?
Mom###normal stuff. Refrigerator, microwave, silverware.
Mae###knives?
Mom###no knife wounds though.
Mae###oh right.
Mae###o_o
Mae###ok i think i got it!
Mom###wow! Whatcha got???
Mae###the guy in the room is a surgeon.
Mae###he implanted a magnet in the dead guy’s skull
Mae###that’s why he has that scar.
Mae###then the suspect used a super magnet or something
Mae###on the dead guy’s forehead
Mae###which pulled the magnet out through the dude’s head.
Mom###ha ha! That’s why he has blood on one hand!
Mae###yup. And i bet the murder weapons are stuck to the fridge
Mae###holding up a pic of Aunt Dottie.
Mom###oh bravo, sweetie!
Mae###:)
Mae###thank you, thank you.
Mom###we’d make quite a pair of investigators.
Mae###could open a detective agency in town.
Mae###:|
Mae###could use one right now probably.
Mom###always work for crimesolvers!
Mae###alright, i’m gonna get going.
Mom###love you, daughter detective!
Mae###you too, inspector mom!
None###not right now, gotta jet.
Mom###oh ok!

Mom###love you sweetie.
Mae###you too mom.
Mae###...
Mae###I'm so worn out.
Mom###Why don't you go take a nap back in the library room?
Mae###Oh wow.
Mae###I haven't been in the library room in years.
Mom###It doesn't get a lot of use these days.
Mom###but it's nice and quiet and peaceful.
Mae###ok. I might do that.
Mom###Door back there's unlocked now, so have at it.
Mom###I'll be out here.
Mae###Thanks mom.
Mom###No problem sweetie.
Mae###I don't think I've ever been up here.
Mom###We used to come here all the time.
Mae###Did we?
Mom###No, we as in "my friends and I when we were your age."
Mae###Oh ok. I'm not used to you using any other we's.
Mom###Believe it or not I've had several we's.
Mae###Huh.
Mae###So what is this place?
Mom###Jenny's Field. Ever heard of it?
Mae###No? I don't think?
Mom###Back in the 30s
Mom###there was this woman and her daughter
Mom###walking here...
Mom###and the woman's daughter is in front of her
Mom###and then she's just gone. Like disappeared.
Mae###What happened?
Mom###Turns out there was a sinkhole that opened up
Mom###when a pillar collapsed in the mines in the hill.
Mae###Geez.
Mom###Yep. No one could see it because of the grass.
Mom###Her name was Jenny. This is Jenny's Field.
Mom###They never found her.
Mom###Just.
Mom###*wwssssp!*
Mom###Gone.
Mae###So... wait, why are we here?
Mom###What, you not up for a little risk taking?
Mae###...
Mae###This is nice.
Mom###Used to be a lot more trees around up here.
Mom###They got cut down when they put in the towers.
Mae###I don't remember that.
Mom###You know, all kinds of things happened before you were born.
Mae###WHAT?!?!
Mom###Some minor parts of history took place, yes.
Mae###AAAAGH!!
Mom###What's wrong?
Mae###I thought it was a... sinkhole thing...
Mom###Hm. How about that.
Mae###...
Mae###Ok... what is that?
Mom###For some reason before Unified pulled out
Mom###they brought this old lime furnace up on the mountain.
Mae###Why?
Mom###Who knows. Unified did a lot of things.
Mae###Looks like it's been here forever.
Mom###It's just sunk into the ground a lot.
Mae###Like Jenny!
Mom###But slower.
Mom###We used to climb up there.
Mae###Wanna try?
Mom###Ha ha ha. Oh sweetie.
Mom###I had you and also a lot of birthdays and donuts since then.
Mom###And not much climbing.
Mae###So... uh...
Mae###Good thing this chimney is sealed up here!
Mom###Ha ha ha. Yes, good thing.
Mom###What can you see up there?
Mom###It's been a while.
Mae###Uh...
None###Possum Springs and most of the valley!
Mom###What does it look like?
None###A quilt?
Mom###Well, it's a cozy valley.
None###Like someone dumped out some blocks?
Mom###Ha ha. Sounds about right.
None###The highway!
Mom###What does it look like?
None###A river? But like made of concrete? With cars?
Mom###Always rolling by, the river.
Mom###Oh, that river. It's big.
Mae###Are you... singing?
Mom###Yeah, it's from a musical?
Mom###Maybe?
Mae###:) \o/
Mae###IT IS NOOOOOOOOW!!!!
Mom###Very nice.
None###A snake? But like made of concrete? With cars?
Mom###Heh heh. An eel maybe?
Mae###Oh my god yes. A massive eel.
Mom###Eels, honey.
Mae###Eels, mom.
Mae###What happened to the eel kid, by the way?
Mom###Someone finally noticed him down there
Mom###and emergency rescue pulled him out of the well.
Mom###And years later he wrote a book about it
Mom###and got rich!
Mae###Did the eels get a cut of it?
Mom###I don't think so.
Mae###That's a crime.
Mom###Won't anyone think of the poor eels?
Mom###Big snake.
Mae###Big snake.
Mom###I got bit by a snake once up here, actually!
Mae###I haven't heard this story.
Mom###Yeah it was a copperhead. Jumped out from under a log.
Mom###My boyfriend at the time, Charlie, he was such a sweetie
Mom###tried to suck the snake poison from the bite on my leg.
Mae###Wow. That's a good boyfriend.
Mom###His mouth went numb and he suffered some tissue damage.
Mom###And I still had to go to the hospital.
Mae###Oh wow.
Mom###Don't suck poison from snakebites, sweetie.
Mae###Right.
Mom###It doesn't work.
Mae###Noted.
Mae###_o_ :|
Mom###I remember I couldn't tell if being up there
Mom###made everything feel bigger or smaller.
Mom###It's a weird feeling.
Mae###Yeah. I know that one.
Mom###I used to have a dream when I was your age.
Mom###Where I was in the big parking lot out by the tracks
Mom###and I'd start running, but there was always more parking lot.
Mae###Hm.
Mom###What do you think it meant?
Mae###I don't know. Feels weird to tell you what your dreams mean.
Mom###Why?
Mae###You're my mom.
Mom###...
Mom###Fair.
Mae###Why did we come up here today?
Mom###Well I was hoping you'd fall into a sinkhole, obviously.
Mae###That didn't work out.
Mom###Drat.
Mom###Guess I'll just have to keep you.
Mae###I couldn't see what your expression was when you said that.
Mom###Do you need to?
Mae###:)
Mae###No.
Mom###Well, see you at home!
Mae###:(
Mae###HEY!
Bea###Well this should be good.
Mae###I wonder what kind of-
Mae###\o/ :(
Mae###OH COME ON!
Mae###There's no one working the counter!
Bea###Oh wow.
Mae###o>
Mae###HELLO?! ANYONE HERE?!
Mae###Geez.
Mae###:|
Bea###This is bleak.
Mae###_o_
Bea###This is like something out of a failed state or something.
Mae###What's that?
Bea###When you make a country and it doesn't work out.
Mae###So... like this country?
Mae###:) =_=
Bea###AAAAAYYYYYY.
Mae###o>
Mae###AAAAAAAAAYYYY.
Mae###o_o :| _o_
Mae###Oh hey it's that band.
Bea###What band?
Mae###You knooooow...
Mae###you remember this song
Mae###had that video that people posted like a zillion times
Bea###I have literally no idea what you're talking about.
Mae###It had that weird horse in it.
Mae###
Bea###Ok yeah I remember. Had a weird horse in it.
Mae###Oh god yeah that horse was all
Mae###
Bea###I remember.
Mae###
Bea###Yep. We have officially remembered that video.
Mae###We did it!
Mae###Looking at this by myself.
Bea###Geeeeeeez.
Bea###Ruins.
Mae###Let's see what they've got.
None###Honky Tonk Armaggeddon.
Bea###Whoa. I'd actually listen to that.
Bea###Just to see what the hell it even means.
Mae###Cover's got a pickup truck exactly like my uncle's
Mae###but this one is on fire and flying at a dragon's face.
Bea###Upgrade.
None###Clubbagurl: Rollin' Hard On That Eeee At This Rave Remixes
Bea###Geez. That's cute.
Mae###What does that mean?
Bea###Someone's very excited to be out on a school night.
Mae###Is it drugs?
Bea###It is drugs.
Mae###Looking at this without bea.
Bea###Ok, we need to go.
Bea###I am getting a contact depressive state from being in here.
Mae###Geez. Yeah.
Mae###Even the giant glowing scribble is depressing.
Bea###Time moved on and left the glowing scribble behind.
Mae###Ok yeah we're leaving.
Bea###Yeah Bill. Write it up as on the clock.
Bill###She’s not gonna like that.
Bea###I don’t care if she doesn’t like it.
Bea###It was her fault. Plain and simple.
Bea###That is time extra. We charge for that.
Bill###Alright then!
Not Stated###Hey, Bea!
Not Stated###What was that all about?
Bea###Ugh. Don’t even ask.
Bea###Mrs. Miranda has locked one of our guys in her basement twice.
Mae###Why?
Bea###Because she’s old and she forgets.
Bea###Maybe if she gets a bill for it she’ll remember next time.
Bea###Hi.
Mae###How’s work?
Bea###Stressful. End of the month coming up.
Bea###And I have to start ordering in winter stuff.
Bea###Which means I have to bribe one or hopefully two of the guys
Bea###To unload the trucks.
Bea###Because I am not carrying in a truckful of rock salt by myself.
Mae###Huh.
Bea###What do you want?
Mae###Well, Gregg asked me to ask you if you would drive us to the party tonight?
Mae###You know, the one up in the state park?
Bea###Thanks for clarifying.
Bea###Otherwise I might have been confused
Bea###As to which of the dozens of parties
Bea###going down on any given night in Possum Springs
Bea###you were referring to.
Mae###...are you being sarcastic? -_-
Bea###I’ll drive.
Mae###o_o :) Great! Thanks!
Bea###We’ll be by your house at 8:30.
Bea###Be ready or we’ll go without you.
Mae###Ok! :|
Bea###Don't get lost on your way home.
Mae###I know where I live.
Bea###No seriously. Go home and get ready.
Mae###Alright, alright! Geez.
Bea###Hey Mae.
Mae###How's the Pickaxe?

Mae###oh woooooooooooooooow.
Bea###yeah. i'm never offering to do this again.
Mae###what are you up to tonight?
Bea###uh. nothing.
Bea###i'm like super tired.
Bea###because everything about my life is exhausting
Bea###and i'm doing the work of like 3 employees, plus a store owner
Bea###even though I'm one employee, and i do not own this store.
Mae###oh weird. I thought for some reason you owned this place now.
Bea###you'd think.
Bea###but also no. i'd rather die.
Bea###literally make me a coffin
Bea###using materials and tools from this store
Bea###and bury me anywhere else.
Mae###geez. that got intense.
Bea###aaaaaaaaaaaaagh.
Bea###anyway. i'm doing nothing tonight.
Mae###i can do nothing too!
Bea###...
Bea###fine.
Bea###So are we doing this?
None###Not sure! Got a couple other stops to make.
Bea###OK.
None###Let's hang out!
Germ###Hi Bea.
Germ###Hi Mae.
Bea###Hi Germ!
Mae###hey dude.
Bea###Germ is helping me move stuff for under the table cash.
Bea###Well.

Mae###Sure!
Bea###Ready to go?
Germ###you got a lot of hammers!
Germ###holy shit there's so many kinds of nails!
Mae###Alright then.
Bea###He's like something out of a children's book
Bea###about whatever the hell he is.
Mae###Hey Bea.
Bea###Yyyyo.
Mae###Sorry about last night.
Mae###I get woozy on cold medicine.
Mae###So I don't really know what I expected to happen.
Bea###Sorry for what I said.
Mae###You know, I don't really remember it much.
Mae###So whatevs.
Bea###Hooray for alcohol.
Mae###New town motto.
Mae###Band practice later?
Bea###Ha ha. Yep.
Mae###I'm amazed it's still a thing.
Mae###We were barely even a band in highschool.
Bea###Eh. It's fun. Get to hang out with Angus.
Mae###How did you even end up doing it?
Bea###When Casey left town, Angus told me that Gregg was really sad.
Bea###So I volunteered to be the new drummer.
Mae###Well, "drummer."
Mae###It's a laptop, Bea.
Bea###It sure is, Mae. It sure is.
Bea###I'll see you later. I got some work to do.
Mae###heyyyy beabea.
Bea###hey Mae.
Mae###how's it going?
Bea###got a load of rock salt to move.
Bea###came in early this year.
Bea###and like a *crapload* of snow shovels...
Bea###usually the distro place doesn't goof up like this.

Bea###yeah that's not a bad theory.
Bea###so what's up?
Mae###wanna hang out tonight????
Bea###uh. i'm working.
Bea###if you wanna like
Bea###come along.
Mae###oh i was thinking we'd go play putt-putt out in Hunwick.

Mae###oh right ok
Mae###Live from the Ol' Pickaxe!
Mae###:|
Mae###When’s this thing supposed to start?
Bea###Uh... 10 minutes... I think?
Mae###You think?
Bea###Ugh this is a nightmare.
Bea###Why did I ever agree to do this?
Bea###Chamber of Commerce owes me big for this.
Mae###Geez. I hear ya.
Bea###...
Bea###...
Mae###What?
Bea###ok so here's the thing- you won't have many lines...
Mae###What?!
Bea###I've had like 3 no-shows!
Mae###Why?
Bea###BECAUSE THIS WHOLE THING IS STUPID AND NOBODY CARES ABOUT IT!!!
Mae###Bea,
Bea###Please? It's a fun part!
Mae###Bea.
Bea###Yeah?
Mae###I will totally save your ass.
Mae###I might have this memorized from when I was a kid.
Bea###Probably not. They rewrote it like 6 times in the past 2 years
Bea###to be spookier
Bea###so it's like 20% actual history now
Bea###and like 80% spooks.
None###So it's like fake history now?
Bea###It's like... the bad remake
Bea###that doesn't respect the source material.
None###Ok weird.
Bea###it starts off normal but gets... anyway.
Bea###You got like 5 minutes to look at your lines.
Mae###Pssh. I can wing it.
Bea###Mae, please don't wing it.
Mae###ok.
Bea###Oh! I didn't see ye there!
Bea###Be ye ghosts?
Bea###Are ye here to hear
Bea###the tale of how Possum Springs came to be?
Bea###Through the mists of time I see
Bea###Weary fur trappers, from 1793.
Dan###Brother John!
Bill###Yes, Brother Steven!
Dan###From this vantage point I do spy a deep hollow
Dan###and within, a great dead tree
Dan###and besides with... uh, which, a spring!
Bill###Blessed are we, brother steven,
Bill###for truly my throat is parched
Bill###from these long and arduous travels
Bill###and carrying these 300 beaver pelts.
Dan###Let us make haste, oh excellent brother!
None###Ho! Travelers! Spare a crust of bread for a needy woman?
None###Ho! Travelers! Help an extremely old woman?
Mae###uh. please help.
Bea###Wha-?
None###Oh no, I am made of cobwebs from being so old!
Bea###Uh. The travelers had no idea what this meant.
None###I must have food to restore my youthful form, for once I was a comely lass.
Bea###...
Bill###Haggard witch!
Dan###Horrible to look upon!
Mae###Cruel young men,
Mae###Ye did not even offer one of thy 300 fine beaver pelts,
Mae###to warm my ancient bones!
None###I shall curse ye, and thee,
Mae###and this very night ye shall perish.
Dan###I am fearful!
Bill###Steady, Brother Steven
Bill###I did not venture out into these hills
Bill###to joust words with a hell-hag!
None###Thou art a rude and naughty boy,
Bill###...
Mae###Thy naughtiness must be met with punishment!
Dan###I... art... uncomfortable!
Bea###Um.
None###Thy punishment is a curse,
Mae###that shall take ye and thee
Mae###even this very night!
Bea###*whew*
None###Thy punishment is a task, terrible!
Bea###wha-
Mae###Thou shall return to thy town...
Bill###um
Mae###Dig up the oldest grave in the churchyard...
Dan###uh
Mae###...and kiss them!
Bill###what?
Bea###But the witch was only joking around
Bea###to frighten the travelers!
Bea###and instead she cursed them to die that very night!
Mae###YEE HEE HEE HEEEEEE!
Mae###I was born among these trees
Mae###'neath a harvest moon
Mae###and ye shall die under that moon!
Dan###Brother John, I am frightened!
Bill###Faith, Brother Steven!
Bill###Art thou so easily shaken by the ramblings of an old crone?
Bill###come, help me carry these 300 beaver pelts.
Bea###...but little did anyone know
Bea###that the witch did not curse...
Bea###IN VAIN.
Dan###Help! Help!
Dan###Who will help a poor traveler?!
Gregg###Uh... um
Gregg###uh, by the moon and stars above us, sir
Gregg###i beseech thee, what is thy trouble?
Mae###you’re in this?
Gregg###yup
Dan###AAAGGGH!! WIIIITCH!!!
Mae###yup
Dan###I swear thee, friend, that this very day
Dan###this horrifying crone
Dan###did curse my brother and I to die!
Gregg###'Zwounds!
Dan###We camped by this very spring beneath the dead tree
Dan###and even now his body lieth upon the earth,
Dan###lifeless as a pile of 300 beaver pelts!
Gregg###Oh! It chilleth the heart!!!
Mae###EE HEE HEE HEEEEEEE!!!
None###I did curse this spring!
Mae###that any man who drinketh from it shall perish!
Dan###AAAGH! I AM SLAIN!
Dan###I join thee now, brother steven!!!
None###A curse upon rude young men!
Gregg###that's not-
Dan###um
Bea###...
Dan###She has cursed the spring, and now I shall die!!!
Mae###wow
Gregg###I am also undone, for I have dranketh of the water!
Mae###Don’t leave me here Gregg.
Gregg###Byeeeeeeeeee.
Bea###and yet, even there
Bea###the curse's lust for blood...
Bea###...WOULD NOT BE SATED!!!
Bea###Gaze upon them! Gaze upon these spirits!
Bill###Brother, we are now ghosts!
Bill###aah! i am tormented by the accusing glare
Bill###of 300 ghostly beavers!
Dan###It would seem that all who die here
Dan###are cursed to never leave!
Bill###Doth that witch know what she hath done?
Mae###uhh... um...
Mae###...crap...
Bea###"Foooooor,
None###For what is a ghost,
Mae###but that which haunts the empty space
Mae###that was once full?
Janitor###And once haunted, can a place be unhaunted?
None###For each man is determined on his path
Mae###and each path leads only to his end.
Bea###ok...?
Janitor###And yet each path may lead to places unknown.
Mae###You!
Mae###from the bus station!
Janitor###Young witch!
Janitor###It is I, the god of the forest!
Mae###uh... just didn’t expect you to...
Janitor###Ain’t that the way.
Mae###So...
Janitor###Witch, thou hast tarried too long in this world
Janitor###I banish thee to wander in the night
Janitor###through the stranger places!
None###Oh god... how did you know...
None###I... what?
Janitor###Young witch, let me speak wisdom to you:
Janitor###We begin and we end,
Janitor###at night, in the woods.
Janitor###but that is not the whole of the story.
Mae###...
Mae###...
Bea###*THIS IS YOUR LINE*
None###Forest god, thou hast no power here!
Janitor###even now, thy end beginneth.
Mae###AAAACK!!! My infernal powers!
Janitor###Sssh, young witch.
Janitor###even now
Janitor###the world you know endeth
Janitor###and who can say what lieth
Janitor###in the world to come?
None###How do you know so much about me?
Janitor###Young witch, I know more than thee could ever know
Janitor###for I am as old as these trees.
Mae###Wow.
Janitor###Beware as you go
Janitor###for there are ghosts.
Bill###[wave]Wooooo!!!
Dan###[wave]Wooooo!!!
Janitor###Take care.
Bea###And so was founded then this festival,

Molly###Tell me what you saw again?
Mae###Someone in a big old coat with someone over their back.
Molly###Uh huh.
Molly###And you chased them down here?
Mae###Yeah and I got to the fence and they were up in the woods.
Molly###Alright. Thank you, Mae.
Mae###Ugh. I knew you were just gonna brush this off.
Molly###Mae, there's been no missing person reports.
Molly###That *tends* to happen when a kid goes missing from something like Harfest.
Molly###Hell, I got 6 calls about kids out too late.
Molly###There would be a report.
Mae###I'M REPORTING!! This! This right here! This is a report!
Molly###Mae, there's no break in the fence.
Mae###So?
Molly###So unless someone could jump this thing...
Molly###while carrying a teenager...
Molly###who hasn't been reported as missing...
Mae###...
Molly###Any theories, Mae?
Mae###...
None###No.
None###They could've gone around the fence!
Molly###I dunno Mae,
Molly###this fence goes out along the parking lots
Molly###almost to the tracks.
Molly###For you to be right behind them,
Molly###and then to be miraculously on the other side of the fence?
Mae###UUUUUUUUURGH.
Molly###I was running around half the night
Molly###getting after teenage bullshit
Molly###and people scared of clotheslines and noises.
Mae###I- you- y-you- aaaargh!!!
Mae###Are you *TRYING* to kick off a horror movie?
Mae###No one believes the girl who saw the ghost!
Mae###Well, I have bad news for you-
Mae###THE COP ALWAYS DIES.
Molly###I'm sorry, we're talking about a “GHOST” now?
Mae###It must've gone through the fence??
Molly###Really, Mae?
Mae###No! Yes! I don't know!
Mae###I'm really tired.
Molly###Yeah that's kinda what I thought.
Mae###Will you at least check the woods?
Molly###Mae, me and Dan McConnell were up there this morning
Molly###because of what YOU said last night.
Molly###From the fence up to the old mine.
Molly###We found a couple teenagers on a gross mattress,
Molly###we saw some worried-looking deer,
Molly###and one deer hunter out too early.
Mae###That can't be it.
Molly###That is it.
Mae###THE COP ALWAYS DIES!
Mae###*pant pant*
Mae###where the hell did he go?
Mae###Shiiiit.
Molly###Mae.
Molly###Go home.
Mae###There's a guy up there on the hill!
Mae###he stole some kid?
Mae###he looked like a ghost!
Molly###a ghost, huh?
Mae###Or something like that?
Molly###Mae, you shouldn't be out here
Molly###doing whatever it is you're doing.
Mae###NO! NO ONE SHOULD BE OUT HERE!
Mae###But there's this guy-

Bea###Yes.
Mae###We're talking about walking to the woods.
Bea###Talking and walking.
Angus###Yes we are.
Gregg###Indeed.
Mae###how did he get over this thing?
Mae###i can’t jump that. No way he could have.
Mae###there’s no hole.
Mae###how did he do it?
Mae###i mean i guess he could really be a ghost
Mae###i think he’s a ghost
Mae###ugh.
Mae###...what’s out there?
Angus###Nice evening.
Mae###Yeah, it’s alright.
Angus###My mom used to take us up here to play frisbee.
Mae###I got hit in the teeth with a frisbee once. full speed.
Angus###geez.
Mae###Casey and me were throwing things at each other's heads.
Angus###oh.
Mae###we stopped after the frisbee.
Angus###POSTED -
Angus###DO NOT FEED
Angus###OR TOUCH
Angus###THE WILDLIFE.
None###well, that seems extreme
Angus###I dunno.
Angus###you can't go to the woods to like
Angus###socialize
Angus###with the woods.
Mae###i guess.
None###well, clearly
Angus###there's some folks living in cabins up here
Angus###you can... uh... feed and touch them if you want.
Mae###...
Mae###it's a weird, old place up here
Angus###there's all kinda of weird stuff back up in the park
Angus###old stuff just hanging out in the woods
Angus###we'll hit my old scout camp on the way up i think
Mae###busy woods
Angus###ok, better get going before it gets dark.
Angus###*puff puff*
Mae###you alright?
Angus###yeah, i got asthma is all.
Angus###sorry you gotta wait for me.
None###do you have an inhaler?
Angus###yeah, but i save that for emergencies.
Angus###being slow isn't an emergency.
None###didn't you run cross country back in junior high?
Angus###yeah but i never finished a race.
Mae###why'd you keep doing it?
Angus###i have no idea.
Mae###what is this thing?
Angus###this is like
Angus###a lime kiln i think?
None###limes?
None###kiln?
Angus###like a furnace.
Mae###oh. furnace for what?
Angus###limestone
Angus###you like do something with it in there
Angus###and it becomes this other thing.
Mae###oh.
Angus###limestone's weird because
Angus###it's mostly made of skeletons of sea creatures
Angus###from millions of years ago
Angus###so like
Angus###this was all underwater or something at one point.
None###whoa
Angus###i know, right?
None###no way
Angus###i mean, rocks don't lie

Angus###*puff puff*
Angus###Phew.
Mae###Need to take a break?
Angus###I'm okay, I'm okay.
Mae###no prob.
Angus###*huff huff*
Mae###so if this place was underwater
None###where'd the water go?
Angus###i dunno. to the ocean i guess.
Angus###and like the earth is always shifting
Angus###so mountains get all pushed up
Angus###where it used to be just flat ground.
None###why aren't there like ancient shark bones up here?
Angus###i dunno. there might be i guess.
Angus###but not everything becomes a fossil
Mae###why?
Angus###i dunno. i'm not an expert on any of this.
Angus###but there were definitely ancient sharks around here.
Mae###weird because things are so boring nowadays
Mae###to think like all that crazy stuff was going on here.
Angus###there's always more weird stuff that happened
Angus###to find out about later.
Angus###ok, i'm ready to go.
Mae###cool cool.
Angus###*puff puff puff*
Angus###*wheeze*

Mae###ancient sea creature rock or whatever
Angus###lime... *puff*... stone...
Mae###i was gonna take a class on dinosaurs back at school.

Angus###you knew they had feathers?
Angus###or some of them?
Mae###i know, right?
Mae###big freaky chickens.
Mae###things were so scary and cool back then.
Mae###we'd die in like 5 minutes ha ha
Angus###oh yeah ancient creatures would eat us, no problem.
Angus###be glad for the millions of years between us
Mae###weird.
Mae###time, dude.
Angus###time makes most dangerous things less dangerous.
Angus###most things, at least.
Mae###ok, you ready to roll?

Pastor###Howdy.
Mae###you waiting for someone?
Pastor###well, i think i'm being stood up.
Mae###a... date?
Pastor###not the kind you mean.
Pastor###honestly a big part of my job
Pastor###is someone calling
Pastor###me heading out
Pastor###and them not showing up.
Mae###you were meeting them at
Mae###the statue of... saint...
Pastor###Rubello.
Mae###yeah. the firebreathing guy
Mae###who like, ate people.
Pastor###that's a bit of an oversimplification
Mae###...
Pastor###but yeah. basically.
Mae###cool guy to have a statue of
Mae###outside the church I mean.
Pastor###well, i didn't put it here
Pastor###but can't we learn something from Saint Rubello?
None###breathe fire
None###eat people
Pastor###sure.
Pastor###this statue is part of our "encourage criminal acts" outreach
Mae###it's working!
Mae###How's the situation?
Pastor###the situation?
Mae###with Bruce and stuff.
Pastor###eh.
Pastor###we wait and see.
Pastor###and pray.
Pastor###I'm gone today! This is an error!
Mae###Bruce situation A3D2?
Pastor###Eh.
Pastor###Ugh. Stressful day.
Pastor###some days you need grace more than others.
Mae###Was this all about Bruce?
Pastor###It was.
Pastor###is.
Pastor###whatever. It's out of our hands now.
Pastor###but there are better hands than mine.
Mae###hm.
Pastor###Anyway, how are you Mae?
Mae###Eh.
Mae###Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh.

Mae###I guess.
Pastor###Hey listen
Pastor###You know
Pastor###If you ever want to talk or have any questions
Mae###about, like, god?
Pastor###sure.
Pastor###you can always talk to me.
Pastor###it's kind of in my job description.
Mae###ok.
Mae###so like
Mae###things have been rough lately
Pastor###i can see that.
Pastor###what seems to be the trouble?
Mae###i think i met god
Pastor###what?
None###it was a dream
Mae###but god talks to us that way, right?
Pastor###sure.
None###i don't think it was a dream
Pastor###oh wow.
Mae###that happens, right?
Mae###or it like, happened.
Pastor###sure.
Pastor###can you tell me about it?
None###i was in this desert
Mae###as far as i could see
Mae###where like
Mae###all that was left of the world
Mae###was bits of wood
Mae###and sand
None###it was like the shore
Mae###of this giant black ocean
Mae###i could see like
Mae###forever into the sky
Mae###and below it was just
Mae###sand
Mae###as far as i could see
Mae###i was wandering through it but
Mae###i was like, drawn to something
Mae###and i came up over this...
Mae###what do you call a hill made of sand?
Pastor###A dune.
Mae###yeah. A Dune.
Mae###and there was god.
Mae###just sitting there. up on another hill.
Mae###or dune. whatever.
Pastor###just hangin' out?
Mae###yeah.
Mae###seemed like they were *really* into just hanging out.
Pastor###did they say anything?
Mae###yeah
None###they like, didn't care
Pastor###they didn't care if you were there?
Mae###no, i mean, they didn't care.
Mae###in general.
None###they were kind of a... jerk
Mae###i mean, more of a straight up asshole.
Mae###sorry. can i say that in a church?
Pastor###ha ha.
Pastor###i think the structure can handle the shock.
Mae###they went on and on about how annoyed they were
Mae###that people kept coming to them with questions
Mae###and annoyed that anyone thought they were god to begin with
Pastor###well, i don't think that was god then
Mae###why?
Pastor###if something tells you it isn't god
Pastor###you should probably believe it.
Mae###no, what i mean is that
Mae###the thing we call god
Mae###isn't god
Mae###it's just a thing
Mae###and it doesn't care
Pastor###hm.
Mae###they kept talking about
None###how nothing matters
Mae###like the universe is ending
Mae###and everything is being forgotten.
None###this giant hole
Mae###in the center of everything.
Mae###growing.
Pastor###that sounds very lonely.
Pastor###have you been feeling lonely lately?
None###yes.
Mae###i had this problem when i was in high school
Mae###and i did something really bad.
Mae###you probably heard about it.
Pastor###your mom has mentioned it.
Mae###yeah i figured.
Mae###well, since then
None###no.
Mae###no, i mean i've got friends
Mae###i've been with them every day since i got home.
Mae###but... hm...
Mae###there's this deep down loneliness
Mae###been there for years
Mae###since... well, just been a long time.
Pastor###i've been there.
Pastor###i mean i'm there all the time
Pastor###i think that's where
Pastor###if we open ourselves up
Pastor###god can enter our lives most effectively
None###i guess
Pastor###sometimes that's the best you've got.
Mae###yeah.
Mae###...
Pastor###i feel like that's maybe not a good enough answer for you
Mae###is that a good enough answer for anyone?
None###i don't think i believe in god anymore
Pastor###if you want the truth
Pastor###i think everyone doesn't believe in god
Pastor###for at least a few minutes a day
Mae###hm.
Pastor###faith is a process
Pastor###you have to keep getting up and choosing to go on
Mae###do you really think there's a god?
Mae###like, literally someone up there listening?
Mae###is that something you completely believe?
Pastor###hm.
Pastor###i don't know.
Mae###oh.
Pastor###on my best days I think I do.
Pastor###but there are times where I don't.
Mae###but... but you stand up there every sunday
Mae###and tell people you do!
Mae###and even *YOU'RE* not sure?
Mae###It's your *JOB* to believe.
Pastor###well, I think it's more my job to serve others...
Mae###but you're lying to people!
Pastor###how?
Mae###you stand up there and tell people to believe
Mae###in something you don't 100% believe in yourself.
Pastor###maybe you're right Mae
Pastor###and maybe I should get up there every week
Pastor###and give some sort of tally of how much I believed that week
Pastor###but who would that help?
Mae###but you're a pastor
Mae###and you can't tell me whether or not god is up there.
Mae###whether anyone is watching
Mae###anyone who gives a shit.
Pastor###no, but-
Mae###:(
Mae###THEN WHAT IS THE POINT OF YOU?
Pastor###...
Mae###:|
Mae###...
Mae###I have to go.
Pastor###ok.
Mae###so what's your story?
Bruce###uh. got no story.
Mae###like, where are you from?
Bruce###north of here. northeast.
Bruce###...
Bruce###worked on the railroads
Bruce###worked some mines
Bruce###worked some construction.
Mae###how'd you end up here?
Bruce###string 'a bad luck
Bruce###...
Mae###don't have to talk about it.
Bruce###i never turn down that offer.
Bruce###Seen a fire through the trees last night.
Bruce###past these woods here.
Bruce###Weird noises.
Bruce###I just kept to myself.
Bruce###and they went away.
None###That sounds spooky.
Bruce###Been around a lotta places.
Bruce###Ain't spooked by much.
Bruce###But out past that water tower...
None###Where?
Bruce###right over there
Bruce###past the water tower.
Mae###oh ok.
Mae###yeah that's a place where teens hang out.
Bruce###let's hope that's all it was.
Bruce###in my experience
Bruce###strange fire and strange voices
Bruce###ain't never been good.
Mae###I wonder if they'll be back...?
Bruce###Hope not.
Mae###getting kinda cold, huh?
Bruce###yeah, nip in the air at night.
Mae###i like fall when it gets cold.
Bruce###me too. real pretty out a'swell.
Mae###i used to cry at fall trees when i was a kid.
Bruce###why?
Mae###because they were so pretty.
Bruce###hm. i did that when my daughter was born.
Mae###you have a daughter?
Bruce###yep.
Mae###where is she?
Bruce###...
Mae###sorry.

Bruce###Aw, don't go to any trouble. I'm alright.
Pastor###That's good.
Bruce###Gonna get cold soon.
Pastor###I can get you some blankets for now.
Pastor###For some reason we have a *LOT* of blankets.
Bruce###That'd sure be a blessing!
Pastor###Well, we bless best with what we already have too much of anyway.
Bruce###Heh heh.
Pastor###And we got blankets!

Pastor###oh!! that's wonderful!!
Council1###alright, troops! move out!
Bruce###I don't feel right about it.
Pastor###I know, but sometimes the right thing doesn't feel right.
Bruce###i just think... it's just wrong to take something
Bruce###when folks don't want you to take it.
Pastor###well...
Pastor###i feel like god would see this differently.
Pastor###i do at least.
Bruce###hmmm
Bruce###that's because you're a good person.
Pastor###
Bruce###
Council2###...because there will be children here!
Council3###and this is a historic church
Pastor###that's half empty!
Council3###that's your job to fix, not ours!

Pastor###we have the space, and we have people who need space.
Pastor###we have resources, and we have poverty!
Pastor###and not in some far off place or some big city!
Pastor###right here! right across the street!
Council1###Katie, it's our number one job right now
Council1###to bring businesses into town.
Council1###businesses mean jobs, and jobs means people.

Mae###Yeah?
Pastor###You’re Candy’s daughter!
Mae###Yeah.
Pastor###I’m Pastor Kate. Your mom works at our church.
Mae###Yep. She’s a professional reception-er.
Pastor###Have you met Bruce?
Mae###Hey Bruce.
Bruce###Hello.
Pastor###Bruce has never been to the Clik Clak!
None###How is that possible?
None###You are in for a treat.
Pastor###See Bruce?
Mae###A greasy, greasy treat.
Mae###and an angry waitress.
Bruce###Sounds like my kinda place.
Pastor###Bruce is new in town so he’s never had the pleasure
Mae###You live around here?
Bruce###um...
Pastor###Bruce is our neighbor up at the church.
Bruce###...I’m camped out across the street...
Mae###oh.
Bruce###in the woods.
Pastor###But not for long! We’re working on fixing that before winter gets here.
Pastor###gonna take some doing, but God’s a do-er.
Bruce###...still thinks it’s a lot of trouble to go to...
Pastor###Listen, nobody said loving your neighbor would be easy.
Pastor###and you are our actual neighbor.
Bruce###I appreciate it.
Pastor###We all need a little help sometimes, Bruce.
Pastor###No shame in hard times.
Mae###Well, it was nice meeting you both!
Pastor###Come up and see me at the church sometime!
Mae###I will! I’ll be up to visit my mom anyway.
Mae###See you later Bruce!
Bruce###ok. Nice to meet you Mary

Pastor###Pastor. Pastor Kate.
Mae###are you guys waiting for someone?
Bruce###no
Pastor###Bruce is a little gunshy
Bruce###ain’t been in a restaurant in a while
Pastor###Click Clack’s as good as any place to start!
Bruce###...gotta get back on the horse sometime…
Mae###You might actually order horse in there without knowing it.
Pastor###Mae...
Mae###It’s true!
Bruce###heh heh.
Council3###oh ok.
Council2###so you're more of a... drifter?
Bruce###Yeah, but it's temporary...
Council1###Of course! Well, we just wanted to see if you're ok up here.
Bruce###Yeah, Pastor Kate has been very kind.
Council4###Mind if we see your setup here?
Council3###What do you think, Molly?
Molly###Uh
Bruce###Uh
Molly###It's... fine?
Council1###Ha ha! Alright... Bruce?
Bruce###Yeah.
Council3###How are you finding Possum Springs?
Bruce###nice place. nice people.
Council4###how long you been in town, bruce?
Bruce###I been here for a while now...
Bruce###and I was here before back in the 70s.
Bruce###They were looking for miners, at least for a while.
Council4###Got a whole thing going here, Bruce!
Bruce###yup.
Council1###pretty impressive!
Bruce###uh
Bruce###thanks.
Council4###Well, we sure appreciate you talking to us, Bruce.
Council2###It was really great to meet you!
Bruce###Yup. Likewise.
Council1###Alright, troops! Let's move out!
Council3###Thanks again Bruce!
Molly###Thanks, Bruce.
Bruce###no trouble.
Council3###That's quite a setup he has there.
Council2###Sure is.
Council4###When I used to go camp with my dad it wasn't nearly that nice.
Council1###Oh really? We belonged to a hunter's camp north of Possum Jump.
Council4###My father's idea of camping was a bit more rustic.
Council3###Quite a setup, he's got.
Council2###He hasn't harmed anyone.
Council1###*sigh*
Council1###it's a toughie.
Molly###I have things to do.
Council3###I don't know that it serves the interests of the community.
Council1###Either way he shouldn't be sleeping outside.
Council4###Can we discuss this indoors somewhere?
Council1###TO THE CLIK CLAK!
Mae###YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!!!!

MaeClamp###Oh! Well!
MaeClamp###Well, don’t mind me!
MaeClamp###See, I’ve already died once tonight.
MaeClamp###No big deal or anything!!!!
GreggClamp###What was it like?
None###I saw a shark I think
MaeClamp###and it told me something important
GreggClamp###what was it?
MaeClamp###i don’t remember.
GreggClamp###couldn’t have been that important then.
MaeClamp###True.
None###I can taste my tooth fillings

Mae###Pizza good.
Gregg###There's a scale of pizza.
Gregg###On one end there's the worst pizza.
Gregg###But like everything right above that

Bea###What's at the other end of the scale?
Gregg###It's pizza all the way up.
None###Empty Text
Bea###i mean it's no pastabilities.

GreggPaws###All glories to the donut.
GreggPaws###The donut's best secret is its middle.
MaePaws###The middle is a hole.
GreggPaws###It's nothing, surrounded by [wave]everything.
MaePaws###But I'm sad when I get to the middle.
MaePaws###Just chomping air.
GreggPaws###Naw dude, like the hole makes you appreciate the donut.
GreggPaws###Another thing, the hole is a handy grip!
MaePaws###Yes. How else are you going to pick things up
MaePaws###If they don't have holes in them.
GreggPaws###Naw, it's like a [wave]contrast.
GreggPaws###Like something and nothing.
GreggPaws###And the nothing, like, helps you get a grip.
GreggPaws###On the something.
GreggPaws###Crap, I had it for a second.
MaePaws###Dude, this is getting deep.
GreggPaws###It's the donuts talking.
MaePaws###I think I can see the past and future.

Mae###Now to the top of the tower
Mae###and I can take that wire right into town!
Mae###I hope no one cut the tree down out front of the house.
Mae###I used to make Mr. Penderson so mad
Mae###jumping all over it and running on the powerlines.
Mae###Whatever, everyone does it.
Mae###Practically another sidewalk.
Mae###Looks like the ladder's gone.
Mae###If I could just get to the top of this thing...
Mae###Ugh.
None###<<wait 1>>​
Mae###<o>
Mae###I could never make it up onto that tree when I was a kid.
Mae###The number logs mocked me.
Mae###The logs and the other kids.
Mae###Lemme see if I can visualize this...
Mae###Mmhmm. Mmhmm.
Mae###Can't stop running while I do this. Not even for a second.
Mae###Gotta have enough momentum.
Mae###I think I can do it.
Mae###Run and jumpjumpjump! \o/
Mae###_o_
Mae###Maybe I should just give up without even really trying?
Mae###Hmm.
None###Ok let's try this run and jump-jump-jump thing one more time.
None###Wait, what do I need to do again?
Mae###<o>
Mae###Can't stop running while I do this. Not even for a second.
Mae###Run and jumpjumpjump! \o/
Mae###_o_
None###Screw this. I hate this.
Mae###Wait, maybe if I try it with my eyes closed...
Mae###U_U
Mae###\o/ o_o
Mae###Faaaaaaaaaantastic!
Mae###I should do this all the time!
Mae###Maybe I can get my driver's license now!
Mae###_o_
Mae###_o_
Mae###Ahoy!
Mae###I definitely remember barely reaching the top of this wheel.
Mae###I definitely remember barely growing since then.
Mae###There used to be one of those spinning block tic tac toe things.
Mae###Because that's why you come to a giant boatcastle.
Mae###To play a dumb game in the dumbest way.
Mae###OH COME ON.
Mae###Don't think I have the upper body strength to climb this...
Mae###You can't keep me out, Possum Springs.
Mae###I am queen of you.
Mae###...
Mae###...could probably just jump off this telephone pole...
Mae###Wow. I haven't been here in maybe 10 years.
Mae###And apparently no one else has.
Mae###I don't know what they were going for here.
Mae###Some sort of boat castle?
Mae###Most of it's gone now.
Mae###Just a thing for weird animals to eat and have babies in.
Mae###I wonder what kind of weird animals have babies in there?
Mae###Dirt Possums. Night Snakes. Mystery beasts of all shapes.
Mae###I remember Cathy Daminco's boyfriend took her here
Mae###to make out and then break up.
Mae###And then the next day Cathy pulled out Cindy Clark's nosering
Mae###at the Fort Lucenne Mall.
Mae###This entire area is so full of romance.
Mae###Hey! You can still see Mr. Snorkles on this!
Mae###Here's a powerline.
Mae###Let's go home.
Mae###wow. We’re up really high.
Mae###and really far out!
Mae###I can’t see town from here
Angus###It’s south of us, behind whatever ridge that is.
Mae###so what, are we just supposed to wait here and see if anything happens?
Angus###you tell me! You’re the expert.
Mae###i guess we’ll just wait here and see if anything happens.
Angus###Nice night.
Mae###Yeah.
Mae###Back at school I couldn’t see as many stars.
Mae###That always made me sad.
Angus###Oh yeah. They’re really nice up here.
Mae###I wish I knew the constellations like you did.
Angus###What?
Mae###You know all the names and the stories and stuff.
Angus###I wish. I can never remember them other than...
Angus###I think that one up there is like a bell or something?
Mae###No. No no no.
Mae###Remember that time we were all at that Longest Night bonfire?
Mae###And we spotted the constellations together
Mae###and you told us all about them???
Angus###That’s not a thing that happened.
Mae###Oh wow. Maybe it was like a dream or something.
Mae###God, I barely remember now.
Angus###I wonder what fake constellations and stories you dreamed up.
Mae###Ok, humor me.
Mae###I’ll find the constellations, you tell me about them.
Angus###ok then.
Mae###graves, huh?
Angus###yeah these were... i forget.
Angus###they were involved in the possum massacre.
Angus###that like labor strike thing
Angus###where it was like the miners vs national guard?
Angus###happened back in town like a hundred years ago.
Mae###why are they up here?
Angus###i think these were some of the bad guys.
Angus###and some of the miners
Angus###didn't want them buried in town.
Mae###oh. huh.
Angus###there's like a few old graveyards up here from like
Angus###colonial times.
Angus###i guess there's one up here somewhere too.
Mae###well.
Mae###that's spooky.
Angus###eh. just bones.
Mae###ancient shark bones!!!
Angus###yeah see? nothing left to be scary.
Angus###yep.
Mae###yep.
Mae###i should come out here more often.
Angus###ha ha ha.
Angus###yeah.
Angus###Don’t look at him.
Mae###Who?
Angus###There’s someone standing behind us.
Angus###In the trees.
Mae###Holy shit.
Mae###Holy shit.
Mae###What do they look like?
Angus###Tall. Wearing some kind of weird coat.
Angus###Like a utility coat or something.
Mae###oh god
Mae###that’s the ghost
Angus###I’m more worried about it being a living person
Angus###standing in the woods, staring at us
Mae###oh god oh god
Angus###Well
Angus###don’t panic
Angus###follow my lead
Angus###hey there
Angus###out for a hike?
Angus###nice night
Angus###he’s... not... answering...
Mae###that’s a little hostile right?
Angus###that’s definitely a little hostile
Mae###HEY!!!
Mae###I KNOW WHAT YOU DID!!!
Angus###Mae, no-
Mae###I SAW YOU!!!
Angus###ok well we’re gonna run now.
Angus###we need to get to the car
Mae###but your asthma

Mae###ok ok ok let’s go
Angus###Deep breaths.
Angus###In.
Angus###Out.
Angus###alright.
Angus###RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWR!!!
Mae###Well
Mae###That was a hike.
Angus###That was a lot easier when I was 11.
Angus###We passed what, 3 gates on the way up here?
Mae###I lost count.
Angus###Weird. Used to be open back then.
Mae###Hm.
Mae###Ready to go?
Angus###Not far now, just up ahead.
Mae###Shopping bags are little ghosts
Mae###of grocery stores
Mae###haunting everywhere else.
Mae###Oh wow I heard a toad.
Mae###And a ghost owl.
Mae###I bet there are any number of potential witch familiars down here.
Mae###There used to be an old sawmill around here I think.
Mae###I mean the park up there's called Sawmill Park.
Mae###Looks like they lost a log load at some point.
Mae###*sigh*
Mae###Gonna have to climb this I guess.
Mae###Well...
Mae###...shit.
Mae###hm...
Mae###Ugh. This is some dank nature.
Mae###Dank nature and garbage.
Mae###Are these Food Donkey shopping carts?
Mae###That's all the way across town!
Mae###That's dedication!
Mae###Wow. Ok. Um.
Mae###Town's on the other side of this
Mae###but this is...
Mae###it's just really dark
Mae###and i'm alone.
Mae###Really dark, really lonely.
Mae###Hey little guys, you gonna light my way?
Mae###Do something useful?
Mae###Maybe if more of your bug friends came along...
Mae###Hm... ok
Mae###Need more bugs probably.
Mae###Not that I'm scared of the dark.
Mae###But yeah.
Mae###Need more bugs probably.
Mae###Need more bugs probably.
Mae###Well it's pretty dark down there.
Mae###But you bugs are doing an ok job of fixing that.
Mae###Maybe we just need a few more of your friends...
Mae###Listen, bugs:
Mae###We need more bugs.
Mae###Oh my god, I'm herding bugs.
Mae###So I can jump off a pipe into a ravine.
Mae###What has happened to my life?
Mae###A few more bugs and I'll jump off this pipe probably.
Mae###Wow.
Mae###I mean screw college anyway
Mae###I'm a bug whisperer!
Mae###Alright! Onward!
Mae###Oh my god.
Mae###That was dangerous!
Mae###I could have died!
Mae###That was amazing!
Mae###I am not gonna die in this hole.
Angus###because it's a flat.
Angus###you don't drive on a flat.
Gregg###why?
Mae###yeah why?

Mae###Geez, man.
Gregg###Geez.

Angus###
Gregg###
Angus###
Mae###geez.
Mae###look at those woods.
Mae###this is like the perfect place to dump a body.
Mae###that’s tough to find.

Mae###eh.
Mae###ok what can fix a flat tire
Mae###uh.

Mae###yeah dude.
Mae###they’re gonna tell stories about this thing
Mae###they’ll never know what it is or how it got here
Angus###you guys sure you’re ok with it?
Gregg###yeah. This is a good home for it.
Mae###Leave it for the kids.
Mae###Let it be a legend.
Gregg###Hm. Yeah.
Mae###too bad it didn't fall on you.
Gregg###too bad you didn't get your arm caught in the gears.
Angus###too bad both of you didn't get trapped in the car
Angus###after a wreck
Angus###and explode all over the road
Angus###and have to be scraped up
Angus###with a snow shovel.
Mae###nice.
Gregg###decent, cap'n.
Angus###heh heh.
Angus###alright, well
Gregg###moooving on...

Mae###Wow! So many possible combinations.
Gregg###We can create our own unique metal offspring.
Mae###So we just... clank these together?
Gregg###Yeah slap 'em together, tighten some screws.
Gregg###What could go wrong?
Mae###I mean, quite a lot, lots of times stuff goes wrong.
Gregg###dude you are no fun
Mae###i literally just died
Angus###wow.
Mae###wow?
Angus###my old scout camp
Angus###used to come up here with my troop
Angus###like a decade ago
Mae###you're the ancient sea monster now.
Angus###looks like it.
Angus###Wow. Looks like some of the whirly note things came back.
Mae###the what?
Angus###uh we made these little windmill things
Angus###and each put an anonymous note in them
Angus###attached to this little spring-controlled helicopter
Angus###and the idea was that when the wind would pick up
Angus###the windmill would wind up the helicopter
Angus###and the note would fly away.
Angus###looks like some of them blew back.
Mae###that's... an amazing coincidence.
Angus###oh no that was the idea.
Angus###each year we'd read notes left from the year before.
Mae###i'm gonna see if i can find any more!
Angus###i'm gonna hike up here. been a while.
Mae###Got one!
Mae###Hmm...

Angus###i spotted 'em.
Mae###Oh cool! Gonna look.
Angus###Aye-aye.
Mae###let's read 'em let's read 'em!
Mae###wait- should we, though?

Mae###ok ok ok ok let's read one!!!
Angus###ok here's one.
Angus###"hi. i'm not supposed to write my name.
Angus###and that's fine, because i am a scout.
Angus###and that is the only name i need."
Mae###wow. that's intense.
Angus###it goes on.
Angus###"the scouts gave me more than a name,
Angus###they gave me badges. to show my worth."
Mae###geez.
Angus###"i would kill for the scouts."
Angus###that's it.
Mae###were you all like this?
Angus###kinda. sometimes. no. maybe.

Angus###"i am super, super gay."
Mae###ha ha ha niiiiiiiice
Mae###angus did you write this one?
Angus###geez. i could have.
Angus###i think my note was about like being strong and good.
Mae###and gay as hell, apparently.
Angus###i think my total gayness came through to the discerning reader.
Angus###alright let's read this note.
Angus###*ahem*
Angus###"i like shooting arrows they are cool to shoot
Angus###in fact i think we should shoot arrows instead of
Angus###guns when we're in the army it has a tactical
Angus###advantage in that it is silent and also
Angus###elegant"
Mae###huh.
Angus###yeah. i got nothing.
Angus###alright this one got kinda torn up
Angus###maybe a bird got it.
Mae###READ THE BIRD NOTE.
Angus###"i am extremely unhappy, and you're the only person who knows."

Gregg###:| _o_
Mae###:| _o_
Mae###Found one I think?
Chazokov###Let me have a look.
Chazokov###Ah yes. Castys.
None###What's Castys?
None###Totally it is.
Chazokov###You know this one already?
Mae###Nope.
Chazokov###This star tells the story of a woman who built a tower to heaven.
Chazokov###And for this the gods sunk her deep into the sea.
Mae###Wow. That's screwed up.
Chazokov###But even in the depths, she refused to die.
Mae###DAMN STRAIGHT.
Chazokov###Oh, will you never die as well?
None###I guess, someday.
None###I dunno.
None###NEVER.
Chazokov###Beh heh heh heh!
Chazokov###Defy Castys' gods also, will you?
Chazokov###The gods in these stories are only stand-ins
Chazokov###for things we cannot control.
Chazokov###You might say floods, or the cancer, or such.
Mae###No to all of them.
Chazokov###This is fair.
Mae###Found one!
Chazokov###Let me have a look.
Chazokov###Ah yes. Dohr The Murderer.
Mae###Ok I'm interested.
Chazokov###Dohr passed Behrn The King's procession on the street.
Chazokov###Dohr was quiet and said nothing, and the King took offense to this.
None###Why?
Chazokov###Royalty is strange.
None###Geez.
Mae###So what happened?
Chazokov###Behrn insulted Dohr, Dohr's family, Dohr's village, and so on
Chazokov###until he was down to insulting Dohr's chickens.
None###Damn.
None###Chickens are kind of awful.
Mae###Weird horrible angry dinosaurs.
Mae###They peck each others eyes out!
Chazokov###They are delicious.
Mae###They deserve to be delicious.
Chazokov###Dohr first murdered Behrn's chickens.
Chazokov###then his ancestral village
Chazokov###then his family
Mae###Holy crap.
Chazokov###And when he came to Behrn
Chazokov###the king was silent.
Mae###I'm going to get a tattoo of this guy.
Chazokov###Is Dohr a hero?
None###Totally.
None###I dunno
Mae###but it doesn't really matter I think?
Mae###Like if you've been told you're nothing before
Mae###A story like this sounds pretty ok.
Chazokov###Well it is a true story and real people died
Chazokov###and you should feel terrible.
Mae###Seriously?
Chazokov###Beh heh heh.
Chazokov###I believe we have seen both stars visible today.
Mae###Oh really?
Chazokov###They come and go so fast.
Mae###Found one Found one found one!
Chazokov###Let's have a look.
Chazokov###Sterling the seer.
Mae###how come I've never heard of these guys?
Chazokov###eh
Chazokov###by the time they got to these rare stars
Chazokov###the well known myths and legends were taken.
Mae###oh.
Chazokov###This one, Sterling, is a tale of the world changing
Chazokov###and leaving one behind.
None###these are all gonna be bummers, huh?
Chazokov###that is not for me to say.
Chazokov###is it a bad thing for the world to move on?
Mae###Well i mean this guy probably doesn't think so.
None###was he not psychic?
Chazokov###who can say?
Chazokov###do we believe any tale occurred?
Mae###hm.
Chazokov###either way, one day his king met a new sage-
Chazokov###an astronomer.
Chazokov###and she showed the king how the planets and stars
Chazokov###orbit in regular patterns, and why.
Chazokov###and the king kicked Sterling out of his quarters
Chazokov###for the seer had long told the king
Chazokov###a different story about the stars.
None###did Sterling believe his own story?
Chazokov###i believe he did.
Mae###well that's how things go.
None###that sounds fair.
Chazokov###is there no responsibility
Chazokov###to care for those whose labors
Chazokov###even one's universe
Chazokov###are suddenly replaced with a new one?
Chazokov###are they obsolete?
None###that's how life is!
Chazokov###so you believe
Chazokov###that some should go hungry
Chazokov###and without homes
Chazokov###because they are no longer useful
Chazokov###to those in power?
Mae###well geez mr. chazokov when you put it that way
None###no.
Chazokov###what is to be done?
Mae###i don't know.
Mae###uh
Mae###isn't there some other job the king could give him?
Mae###or some way
Mae###where he doesn't have to be useful to the king
Mae###in order to survive?
Chazokov###it's one to ponder!
Chazokov###beh heh heh
Chazokov###the stars! they make one think!
Mae###BOOM!
Mae###Found one!
Chazokov###let's see.
Chazokov###Ah yes! Simone the fighter!
Mae###she got a gun
Chazokov###Simone lived in a good land
Chazokov###but under every good land are the roots of oppression
Chazokov###and in this land those roots took hold
Chazokov###and choked out all else.
None###that was poetic, Mr. Chazokov
Chazokov###thanks. I was just reading the summary off my phone.
Mae###oh
Chazokov###we may not have signal, but we have wifi!
None###geez.
Chazokov###it happens faster than one can imagine
Chazokov###Anyway, when the borders closed and the curfew began
Chazokov###Simone and her comrades began to plot.
Chazokov###they infiltrated, they sabotaged, they freed prisoners.
Mae###very nice.
Chazokov###Simone was one of the first to be identified
Chazokov###but she evaded capture even as the wanted posters went up.
Chazokov###As whispers of her grew throughout the land
Chazokov###more and more of her neighbors prayed in the night
Chazokov###that Simone would be their salvation.
None###was she?
None###that's a lot of pressure for one person.
Chazokov###She was not alone, of course.
Chazokov###she was but one part in a growing organism
Chazokov###but she became a symbol.
Chazokov###it is difficult to think of many things
Chazokov###so sometimes having a symbol for all of them
Chazokov###is important.
Mae###like numbers.
Chazokov###We do not know where Simone is buried.
Mae###ah goddammit. i knew this wasn't going to be happy.
Chazokov###we do know that when things boiled over
Chazokov###she led a charge against the palace gates
Chazokov###and behind those gates were cannons.
Mae###oh no.
Chazokov###many years later when the mass graves were exhumed
Chazokov###her bones were mixed with so many others
Chazokov###it was said that she now lives on
Chazokov###in the bones of all in her country.
Mae###geez. that got dark. and sad. and spooky.
Chazokov###Beh heh heh.
Chazokov###that is history!
Chazokov###That's both of them for today!
Mae###neato!
Mae###FOUND! ONE!
Chazokov###LET'S! SEE!
Chazokov###big snake.
Mae###"big snake?"
Chazokov###yep.
None###anything else?
None###i saw a big snake once.
Chazokov###at the zoo?
Mae###in scouts we were hiking
Mae###and one was sunning itself on a rock.
Chazokov###what a treat!
Mae###i was thinking it's rare to see a snake just randomly relaxing.
Mae###what's up with this one?
Chazokov###Big Snake emerged from the earth and made war upon the villages.
Mae###what villages?
Chazokov###you know. villages.
Mae###ok.
Chazokov###and as he wrapped himself around them
Chazokov###the villagers saw that they were encircled by the same-
Mae###big snake
Chazokov###- and they came together
Chazokov###and together slew the-
Mae###big snake.
Chazokov###you learn.
Mae###why did big snake attack the people?
Chazokov###do you have sympathy for the big snake?
Mae###geez i dunno but can we just keep saying big snake?
Chazokov###big snake
Mae###big snake
Chazokov###big
Mae###snake
Mae###Star located, captain.
Chazokov###Let us consult the guide.
Chazokov###oh, you will like this one.
Mae###really?
Chazokov###because they are dead.
Mae###ok yeah i'm into it.
Chazokov###Gramercy The Medium
Chazokov###in life he spoke with the dead?
Mae###really?
Chazokov###who knows.
Chazokov###but when he died
Chazokov###his own spirit returned and spoke through him.
Mae###wait. that's dumb.
Chazokov###how so?
None###that's just called being alive
Chazokov###not so! his body was dead!
Mae###so he was like a zombie?
Chazokov###but just as smart as before!
Chazokov###no looking for brains.
Mae###so like normal but he smelled bad?
Chazokov###just so.
Mae###why did they make this guy into a star?
Chazokov###i have no idea.
Mae###i guess it's kind of impressive.
Mae###dumb, but impressive.
None###how did... wait... what?
Chazokov###his own spirit possessed his body.
Mae###that's like literally the same thing as being alive.
Chazokov###no, he was dead but possessed
Mae###by himself.
Chazokov###yes.
Mae###oh god this is dumb.
Mae###so what's the moral of this one?
Chazokov###moral?
Mae###yeah usually star things like this have some sort of moral.
Chazokov###sometimes things are just strange!
Mae###that's the moral?
Chazokov###beh heh heh
Chazokov###That is our pair for the day!
Mae###Well gee willikers, Mr. Chazokov!
Chazokov###beh heh heh
Chazokov###"willikers".
Mae###I think I got one?
Chazokov###let us see.
Chazokov###Kol the mountaineer.
Mae###Kol.
Mae###Knew a guy named Cole once? That's close?
Chazokov###it is.
Mae###so what's up with this guy?
Chazokov###Kol was from a flat land.
Mae###this midwest?
Chazokov###whatever the midwest of wherever he was from was.
Mae###every place has a midwest.
Chazokov###this is true.
Chazokov###he dreamed of mountains
Chazokov###and devoted his life to climbing them.
Mae###...because his hometown was flat?
Chazokov###isn't this a common instinct?
Chazokov###to seek that which is unlike where one grows up?
None###yeah
Mae###i mean people go to the city a lot.
Mae###like they move there because it's got stuff
Mae###and there's more people like them maybe.
Mae###sucks though. not everyone can just up and leave.
Chazokov###when I left my country
Chazokov###i felt this same thing.
Chazokov###but i have not regretted it.
Mae###you like possum springs?
Chazokov###it is beautiful in ways perhaps invisible
Chazokov###to those who have seen it every day of their lives.
None###not really.
Mae###I like home.
Mae###I like my neighborhood
Mae###I like the bad diner food.
Chazokov###it is not good.
Mae###but it's good bad
Mae###like a story a your friend wrote
Mae###and gave you to read.
Chazokov###i like the disco fries.
Mae###so what happened to Kol?
Chazokov###he returned home
Chazokov###and complained that the sky felt heavy
Chazokov###he had been up into the clouds
Chazokov###and now they rested hard upon him.
Mae###that's a really specific complaint.
Chazokov###when one leaves a place
Chazokov###one brings something back when one returns.
Mae###one.
Chazokov###one.
Mae###Gotcha!
Chazokov###oooh... which one is this?
Chazokov###Adina Astra
Mae###!!!!
Chazokov###you know this one?
Mae###YES! I KNOW THIS ONE!!!!
Chazokov###It's a common story.
Chazokov###how Adina journeyed to the frozen lake
Chazokov###how she traversed unknown faraway lands
Mae###i was very into Adina stories when I was a kid.
Chazokov###so you must know what became of her?
Mae###...yeah
Chazokov###how she, in her quest,
Chazokov###turned her back on the sky
Chazokov###and journeyed down into the earth
Chazokov###where her stars were no longer over her head
Chazokov###and how she was never seen again?
Mae###yeah.
Mae###whatever.
Chazokov###is that not a sad ending?
None###yeah. i mean, she probably died.
Chazokov###she lived well. she did many amazing things.
Chazokov###it is not sad to die having done so much.
Mae###i guess. still sucks. dying.
Chazokov###it is a shame.
None###no. disappearing isn't the same as dying.
Mae###she probably went somewhere else completely
Mae###and did all kinds of cool shit.
Chazokov###oh my!
Mae###yeah so. whatever.
Chazokov###Ooof! That's all for the day!
Mae###That was nice.
Mae###Found it!
Chazokov###let us consult the guide.
Chazokov###Erskine The Firemaker.
Mae###"the firemaker?"
Chazokov###a wanderer in the cold and dark
Chazokov###making a fire and huddling up to it.
Chazokov###for light and warmth.
Mae###sounds festive.
Chazokov###sounds like survival.
Mae###hm.
Mae###this star makes me want to cry.
Chazokov###crying? on my roof?
Chazokov###do you wish to talk about it?
Mae###no. it's fine.
Chazokov###is it a happy cry, or a sad cry?
Mae###i dunno. i don't have great words for it.
Chazokov###it is ok.
Chazokov###sometimes too many words.
Mae###yeah.
Mae###thank you for this.
Chazokov###thank you for joining me.
Chazokov###I think we have discovered... them all?
Mae###Well, we didn't really discover them, right?
Mae###i mean someone else already saw them and named them
Mae###wrote a whole bunch of stuff about them
Mae###and we just like
Mae###found what they made for us.
Chazokov###is that not a discovery?
Mae###not really.
Chazokov###maybe not in the historical sense
Chazokov###we did not create the stars
Chazokov###or name them
Chazokov###but we had these autumn afternoons
Chazokov###and found them together.
Chazokov###isn't that something?
Mae###something something something.
Mae###my granddad said something like that once.
Mae###something about a story having really happened
Mae###because hearing it happened to you.
Chazokov###that is nice.
Mae###it's not bad.
Mae###HOLY CRAP my eyes!!
Chazokov###Oh - you want to put the filter on like so...
Mae###GEEZ!!
Chazokov###The sun is bright! Make you blind!
Mae###You didn't think to mention this?
Chazokov###I just did!
Mae###Whaaaaaaaargh my eyes!!
Chazokov###Filter!
Mae###Uuuugh.
Mae###AAARGH I'M BLIND!!
Chazokov###This is your own fault at this point I would say.
Mae###Hmm... I can't figure this out
None###Give Up
None###Try Again
Mae###I think I have a great-great-uncle or something on this.
Mae###Yep, there you go. Anselm Borowski.
Mae###"Anselm?"
Mae###Even in life, he was tragic.
Mae###A possum on top, of course. Always, always a possum.
Mae###We like our war monuments in Possum Springs.
Mae###There are 2 really ancient ones over in Olde Possum Springs.
Mae###Three in town proper.
Mae###And I think they put a new one up on Pill Hill.
Mae###There's one up by Possum Jump, but that one's spooky.
Mae###I haven't been up there since that party we're not going to think about.
Mae###Years ago I thought when I was 20 I'd never be able to climb this high up anymore.
Mae###Shows what you know, little Mae.
Mae###...
Mae###I think these are supposed to be weather stations?
Mae###Pioneer Scouts made them when they weren't playing football
Mae###or learning about [wave]MANHOOD[/wave].
Mae###These are the manliest of miniature windmills for sure.
Mae###My god.
Mae###What kind of weather did I miss?
Mae###This is nuts.
Mae###Oh well, wasn't going to church anyway.
Gregg###=_=
Travis###You suck, Mae.
Mae###...
Travis###Yeah, you heard me.
Mae###......
Travis###You suck.
Mae###You are the WORST.
Travis###My car got trashed.
Mae###Maybe if you weren't such a jerk...
Travis###Wait what? Where's this coming from?
Mae###Maybe it was... carma.
Travis###Like Karma?
Mae###N-no... You don't. Oh.
Travis###Nice.
Mae###CAUTION: Do not jump on street lights.
Mae###Do not run on power lines.
Mae###Do not leap between roofs.
Mae###You could die.
Mae###Thank you!
Mae###So... um... what happened?
Gregg###Snuck into the elevator
Gregg###but when I got out here the window shut behind me.
Mae###Why were you coming up here to begin with, dude?
Mae###You're not exactly cut out for jumping around roofs.
Gregg###I guess I'm just not feeling it today
Gregg###so I thought I'd throw something off the roof.
Gregg###Oh yeah, I also stole a garden gnome.
Mae###Just having one of your off-days?
Gregg###I guess.
Mae###I was thinking before of what would happen
Mae###if I burned myself alive in my bedroom.
Gregg###ok. :| o_o
Mae###I was thinking that I'd totally haunt here forever.
Mae###Just really bum everyone out.
Gregg###Oh dude I'd bite everyone in the ass.
Gregg###They'd be like what the hell, who just bit my ass???
Gregg###RAWR ASSBITE!!!!![/shake] D:
Gregg###:|
Mae###I was thinking about being here forever.
Mae###Or being anywhere forever.
Mae###Like a dracula.
Gregg###If I was gonna haunt someplace forever, I don't know if it'd be Possum Springs.
Gregg###This town sucks. This town is a dracula.
Gregg###Tell you what:
Gregg###You go down, ride the elevator back up and let me back in.
Gregg###Then we can borrow Bea's car and go to Donut Wolf.
Mae###I dunno... Bea and I aren't really...
Gregg###No it's cool, me and angus borrow it all the time.
Mae###Sweet dude. Did you want to throw this gnome?
Gregg###I dunno. What do you think?
Not Stated###Naw dude. This gnome's partying with us tonight.
Not Stated###Obviously. This isn't even a question.
Gregg###Yep, that did it. I feel better.
Mae###Good dude.
Gregg###Can we get off this roof now?
Mae###I am never gonna let you live this down.
Gregg###Hey asscat, you want Donut Wolf or not? -_-
Mae###AWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!![/shake] \o/
Gregg###RIDE THE CHARIOT![/shake] D: \o/
Mae###To Donut Hell!!!![/shake] \o/ :D
Gregg###You got lucky, gnome.
Mae###Stop talking. Donut Wolf.
Gregg###Get going already!
Mae###AWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!![/shake] \o/ :)

Mae###Um... hey there. You ok?
Bruce###...
Mae###You from around here?
Bruce###No.
Mae###You from off the train, then?
Bruce###Got sick, had to stop. Everyone knows not to stop in Possum Springs anymore.
Mae###On account of our stringent vagrancy policy?
Bruce###Some hold their breaths when we roll through town.
Mae###Uh huh? So what are you doing up here?
Bruce###Sleeping. Keeping off the streets.
Mae###Can't be very warm.
Bruce###It's a lot colder in the west end of town. Best keep high and eastward.
Mae###Ok then, we'll I'll be going...
Bruce###At dusk I have to make it to the tracks and hop anything out of here.
Bruce###But truth is, I'm too afraid to leave this roof.
Mae###Afraid of what?
Bruce###"Don't get off in Possum Springs." I knew that.
Bruce###I got off here. I screwed up.
Mae###What are you afraid of?
Bruce###...
Mae###Hey listen, dude, I mean if you want to hang out up here I don't care.
Mae###Just don't like steal anything or eat anyone's pet or whatever.
Mae###I mean hey, we all have hard times, and
Bruce###I don't want to talk to you anymore.
Bruce###Please go away.
Bruce###...
Mae###I thought he stopped doing the peeing thing.
Mae###Something must be pretty wrong.
Mae###'sup!
Mae###You guys are still in highschool, right?
Teen3###Yeah probably.
Mae###Man, me and Gregg totally set that place on fire once! :)
Teen1###You didn't burn it down, though.
Mae###:|
Mae###No, but I mean...
Teen2###So the story here is that you didn't burn the school down.
Teen1###That's easy to do.
Teen3###Look at us. We're also not burning down the school.
Teen2###But you don't see us bragging about it.
Mae###I'm not bragging! :(
Teen1###Oh ok then. What did you want?
Mae###Nothing! Geez!
Mae###:|
Teen1###
Teen1###
Teen1###
Teen1###Yo, you know Gregg, right?
Mae###He's my best friend.
Teen2###Aw.
Teen3###Dude shut up.
Teen1###Yeah I think he's stuck on the roof.
Mae###Wait what?
Teen2###Yeah I think he went up there and got locked out.
Teen3###He looks so sad.
Teen1###I was gonna call my mom to tell her to call the fire department, but...
Mae###Why is he up on the roof?
Teen2###Pssh. I don't know, and I'm not his [color=EC4D67][wave]best friend[/all].
Teen3###You are such a dick.
SteveScriggins###Huh. Didn't know you were [color=999999]back.
Not Stated###Geez, does everyone know?
Not Stated###Do I know you?
SteveScriggins###Got any copper?
SteveScriggins###No shame in quittin', quitter. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Mae###Oh god, you're Steve Scriggins.
Mae###I didn't know you were still in town.
SteveScriggins###Yeah, strippin' copper.
Mae###Ok
SteveScriggins###We have big bonfire in the field behind my brother's house every weekend
SteveScriggins###to burn off all the building scrap stuff that isn't copper.
Mae###Um
SteveScriggins###Because of all the stuff in it the fire burns like 10 times hotter.
Mae###...
SteveScriggins###You can't get near it without dying!
SteveScriggins###You should come sometime!
Mae###no.
SteveScriggins###ok.
SteveScriggins###Steve Scriggins
Mae###I... I'm not sure...
SteveScriggins###You may remember my handiwork, I locked that [color=999999]teacher...
Mae###...in the supply closet...
SteveScriggins###IN THE [color=999999]SUPPLY CLOSET
Mae###...before Christmas break. He was in there for
SteveScriggins###TWO WEEKS!
Mae###He ate spanish workbooks and drank glue to survive. :\
SteveScriggins###YEAH HE DID!
Mae###:|
Not Stated###Why did you do that?
Not Stated###Didn't he die from that?
SteveScriggins###¯\_(ツ)_/¯
SteveScriggins###I'm a [color=999999][wave]menace!
SteveScriggins###Nope, he walked into an open sewer!
Mae###Oh my god really?
SteveScriggins###Excellent death!
Mae###Wow, yeah. Excellent death.
SteveScriggins###Inspiring. I hope I go out like that or in a shootout with the cops.
Mae###Those are both very attainable goals.
SteveScriggins###...[wave]EXCELLENT
Mae###I saw a weird possum over there last week. Still filled with such dread.
Mae###I could go visit Angus at work or hit the Snack Falcon, but I dunno.
Mae###They're over there.
Mae###With the possum.
Mae###Is there anything more depressing than the vacant ruins of the party barn?
Mae###I'm too depressed to go any further.
Mae###Aw!!! everything is so great and harfesty!!!
Mae###which is basically just a less spooky halloween?
Mae###whatever!
Mae###i just wanna head home and get ready for tonight!!!!
Mae###i could just do that...
Mae###or i could wander a bit...
Mae###take in the harfesty air...
Mae###well, i'll get home when i do.
Council2###That ferris wheel looks like a nightmare.
Council3###Thanks, Colleen. That's helpful.
Council1###What's wrong with it?
Council2###I don't trust giant load-bearing machines you can assemble and disassemble in one day.
Council1###It's the Hit Record! We've always had the Hit Record at Harfest!
Council4###Yeah. Since 1984.
Council3###Maybe that's a clue that we should retire it.
Council4###SHUT UP ANDREW.
Council2###Ok everyone let's just take a step back here and cool down.
Council1###WE. ARE. GOING. TO. HAVE. THE. HIT. RECORD. AT. HAR. FEST. TO. NIGHT!!!

Mae###I think I have a great-great-uncle or something on this.
Mae###Yep, there you go. Anselm Borowski.
Mae###"Anselm?"
Mae###Even in life, he was tragic.
Mae###We like our war monuments in Possum Springs.

Mae###There's one up by Possum Jump, but that one's spooky.
Mae###I haven't been up there since that party we're not going to think about.
Mae###I mean Gregg still has that helmet from World War 1...
Mae###With the bullet hole in it...
Mae###Like 10 guys from my high school class went off to army.
Mae###Gotta afford college some way or another.
Mae###I've never been to war.
Mae###Not like the recruiter didn't try, though.
Mae###Hard.
Mae###War is some bullshit.
Mae###You hear me, statue?
Mae###I guess you were drafted.
Mae###ugh.
Mae###you died before you got to enjoy the statue they made of you.
Mae###it's garbage.
Mae###they can't make me go to war.
Mae###i'll go underground.
Mae###i'll join some sort of group that's against war and stuff.
Mae###we'll blow up war stuff and sabotage other... war stuff.
Mae###i'll live in the shadows for decades.
Mae###no address.
Mae###always on the run.
Mae###living in a trailer in the desert.
Mae###it'll be awesome.
Mae###Wow! Construction's finally done!
Mae###Stairs is open for business!
Mae###wonder what's going on up there?
Donna###What?
TZEmployee2###And where exactly are you planning on going?
Donna###I dunno. Ham Panther?
TZEmployee2###But honey you're only gonna get minimum there.
TZEmployee2###And I hear they're murder...
Donna###*THIS* place is murder.
Donna###I don't think I can handle one more incoming call.
Donna###I wake up sometimes because I hear that *BING* noise.
TZEmployee2###Nowadays I just take a sleeping aid. Works wonders.
Donna###We shouldn't have to drug ourselves to get our sleep back from this job!
TZEmployee2###Well, Ham Panther isn't gonna give you a bonus.
TZEmployee2###Ham Panther doesn't even have a leaderboard.
Donna###But it isn't calls.
Donna###It isn't sales.
Donna###I wouldn't be  waiting for that *BING*.
TZEmployee2###I don't know, honey...
TZEmployee2###Maybe you'll have a good shift today and get on the leaderboard
TZEmployee2###And we'll see how you feel then?
Donna###I guess. But it won’t change anything.
Mae###Hey Bea.
Bea###Yyyyo.
Mae###Sorry about last night.
Mae###I get woozy on cold medicine.
Mae###So I don't really know what I expected to happen.
Bea###Sorry for what I said.
Mae###You know, I don't really remember it much.
Mae###So whatevs.
Bea###Hooray for alcohol.
Mae###New town motto.
Mae###Band practice later?
Bea###Ha ha. Yep.
Mae###I'm amazed it's still a thing.
Mae###We were barely even a band in highschool.
Bea###Eh. It's fun. Get to hang out with Angus.
Mae###How did you even end up doing it?
Bea###When Casey left town, Angus told me that Gregg was really sad.
Bea###So I volunteered to be the new drummer.
Mae###Well, "drummer."
Mae###It's a laptop, Bea.
Bea###It sure is, Mae. It sure is.
Mae###Hey cat.
Mae###How’d you get up here?
Mae###You put in all of this effort just to sleep?
Mae###I have rarely related more to an animal.
Mae###Here, at the end of the world:
Mae###a sleeping cat.
Mae###Hey cat.
Mae###When I was little I never thought I’d be able to get up here.
Mae###And you’re like half the size of little me.
Mae###You win.
Mae###Takes a lot of parties to keep a barn open.
Mae###I don’t know how it even survived as long as it did.
Mae###I don’t think Gregg got permission to have band practice here.
Mae###We are so gonna get evicted.
Mae###Then the barn shall once again be silent.
Mae###I am not climbing these stairs today. Don't need to go to church.
Mae###No gods, no masters, no effing stairs today please.
Mae###Hey!
Saleem###Hello.
Mae###I'm Mae!
Saleem###Hello Mae, I'm Saleem.
Mae###Are you a busker? Are you busking?
Saleem###What’s busking?
Mae###I don’t know.
Mae###I think it’s when you play outside and people give you money.
Saleem###Are you gonna give me money?
Mae###No.
Saleem###then I’m not busking.
Mae###Cool.
Mae###Still up here?
Saleem###I mean, I left and went to work and so forth since we met.
Mae###Hm
Mae###is that a fiddle?
Saleem###it's a violin.
Mae###that's like the same thing, right?
Saleem###it's a violin, i assure you.
Mae###Has anyone complained?
Saleem###About what?
Mae###You playing.
Saleem###I don’t think anyone cares, honestly.
Saleem###or they like it.
Saleem###i'm fine either way.
Mae###I just met someone else playing by themselves
Saleem###Really?
Mae###Yeah. Across town in the abandoned building by the Clik Clak.
Mae###they had one of those big saxophones.
Saleem###Hm.
Mae###I just thought it was an interesting coincidence.
Saleem###Small town.
Mae###You know that woman I mentioned across town?
Mae###I think she’s looking for people to play with.
Saleem###really?
Mae###Yeah. Just saying.
Mae###I told her I’d mention it.
Saleem###I’ll keep it in mind.
Mae###I'm not saying you *HAVE* to go play with her or anything-
Saleem###I get it.
Mae###I don't want to make this weird,
Saleem###It'll be a lot less weird when you stop making it weird!
Mae###So there's this woman across town.
Mae###Sadie.
Saleem###ok?
Mae###like up in the abandoned building by the clik clak?
Saleem###oooooook?
Mae###anyway she's playing saxophone by herself all the time
Mae###maybe you two could play together?
Mae###since you're also doing basically the same thing.
Saleem###oh. hm.
Mae###I told her I’d mention it.
Saleem###I’ll keep it in mind.
Mae###I'm not saying you *HAVE* to go play with her or anything-
Saleem###I get it.
Mae###I don't want to make this weird,
Saleem###It'll be a lot less weird when you stop making it weird!
WindowAngry###HEY! GET DOWN FROM THERE!

Mae###Oh. Ok.
Janitor###So what’s it been like being home again?
Janitor###Things like you remember ‘em?
None###Kinda.
None###No.
Mae###I don’t know.
Mae###I don't even remember today.
Janitor###Sounds like you been through something.
Mae###How did you know?
Janitor###Call it experience.
Janitor###I swear some mornings I feel every bit as old as these trees.
Mae###You know, something big did happen
Mae###and I feel like I should have woken up today
Mae###and like, have learned something.
Mae###But I don’t know if I learned anything, really.
Janitor###Weeeell,
Janitor###in my experience the big things don’t teach you anything
Janitor###but they make you something
Janitor###and sometimes you gotta wait a while and see what come of it.
Mae###huh.
Janitor###Welp, done an honest day’s work.
Janitor###quittin’ time!
Janitor###Smelters game tonight!
Mae###See ya around.
Janitor###Not if I see you first, Mae.

Mae###I don’t think Angus is working today.
Mae###Who goes to a video store anyway?
Mae###I wonder if it’s just weird creepos going to the adult vhs section.
Mae###Creepo: one who demands their porn be delivered via obsolete machines.
Mae###I mean, the rest of us use modern machines like civilized people.
Mae###Granddad read me a story once
Mae###about a sailor whose ship was sinking
Mae###and he climb up one of the ship... poles?...
Mae###and the ship landed on some coral or something before it totally sank
Mae###and he was stuck on the ship pole for a week
Mae###watching the sharks circle.

Mae###Dude ate sea birds and drank hurricane rain.
Mae###Saw sea-ghosts.

Mae###who knew goats were such good swimmers?
None###the minigolf ice cream place.

Mae###i miss you, pizza place.
Mae###wow.
Mae###our very own taco place.
Mae###HOLY CRAP!!!!!
Mae###A...
Mae###AAAAAAAH
Mae###A TACO PLACE!!!!
Mae###this is the best thing that’s happened to this town since
None###they got rid of all those snakes in the diner!
Mae###the owners were religious
Mae###and they called in a preacher
Mae###from one of the holiness camps up in the hills.
Mae###and he got in there and yelled at the snakes to leave.
Mae###the next day after he died they just set traps.
Mae###nobody knows where they came from
Mae###or why they moved in.
Mae###but they’re long gone now.
None###we got internet!
Mae###we were still using CyberFish until like 2 years ago.
Mae###because it’s eternally 2 decades behind here.
Mae###takes you 3 days to torrent a movie.
Mae###takes you 1 day to load a gif.
Mae###barbaric times.
Mae###god.
Mae###life moves on, huh.
Mae###oh my god! They deliver!!!
Mae###I’m gonna eat the shit out of some tacos.
Mae###so how did that arm get here…
Mae###someone just running down the street
Mae###“whoops my arm fell off!”
Mae###“i’ll just come back for that later!”
Mae###no one could survive their arm just falling off
Mae###or being chopped off
Mae###like, not by a doctor.
Mae###is it still called assault if you chop an arm off?
Mae###seems like it should be a different word.
Mae###“armchoppy”
Mae###you are under arrest for armchoppy!
Mae###whoever’s arm that was is probably dead.
Mae###nah. Definitely.
Mae###unless I see someone walking around
Mae###who until recently had an arm.
Mae###now here’s a man who loved statues.
Mae###don’t get a lot of people getting statues made of themselves today.
Mae###we’re secure in ourselves, ok.
Mae###we don’t need statues to make us feel better.
Mae###if i got a statue i’d have them make me real tall
Mae###what the hell is a malt?
Mae###“too”?
Mae###is that like “two”
Mae###or like “also”
Mae###this is an error so bad even i wouldn’t make it.
Mae###also where was the other video outpost?

Council1###cathleen, we are not going to put a rest home down here!
Council4###it's just wasted space!
Council4###And they're down here anyway at Trolleyside News everyday!
Council2###We are not putting our eldery in a hole!
Council1###Yeah colleen!
Molly###'Least if we closed it I wouldn't have to keep an eye on this place.
Council3###thank you, molly. That's helpful.
Molly###If you're all done I got things to do.
Council1###Yeah fine.
Council3###This was of historical note.
Council2###this sure is a picture.
TunnelTeen1###Hey don't you know Lori?
Mae###Yeah.
TunnelTeen1###Oh ok.
TunnelTeen2###I thought so
TunnelTeen3###So you're like a college dropout, right?
None###Mind your damn business!
TunnelTeen2###Fine.
None###Yeah I guess.
TunnelTeen3###What happened?
TunnelTeen4###You fail out?
None###Mind your damn business!
TunnelTeen4###Fine.
None###It just didn't work out.
TunnelTeen4###What does that mean?
TunnelTeen1###Yeah what?
Mae###I had kind of a slow nervous breakdown.
TunnelTeen1###Cool.
Mae###Well... ok sure.
Mae###Hey hey! Gimme all yer pretzels!
Mae###Hey!
Mae###Hey!
Table1###Do you mind? He's in a [speed=.5]pierogi trance[/speed]. Come back later.
Mae###I come here all the time and I've never seen a pierogi trance.
Table1###He's makin' something [speed=.5]extra special[/speed], [wave]dear.[/wave] Something that ain't never been pierogi'd before.
Mae###Ugh. [color=aaaaaa]Dear.
Mae###Hey, I just got back in town
Mae###and the one thing I missed most was-
Cook###HEY!
Cook###I REMEMBER YOU!
Mae###:) o/
Mae###Hello!
Cook###THIEF!
Mae###:| _o_
Mae###Oh COME ON.
Mae###That was years ago!
Cook###ONCE A THIEF, ALWAYS A THIEF.
Mae###Alright, you know what? =_=
Not Stated###I’m not a thief! You take that back!
Not Stated###This isn't even a restaurant!
Mae###I’ve stolen from better places than this! o_o
Mae###I wouldn’t lower myself to steal from here!
Cook###YEAH YEAH YEAH
Cook###GO JUMP IN THE RIVER.
Mae###It's a crappy foodstand in a hole!
Cook###This establishment has been in business for 50 years!
Mae###50 CRAPPY YEARS IN A HOLE! o_o
Mae###You know what else has been in a hole for 50 years?
Mae###\o/ :(
Mae###DEAD PEOPLE FROM THE 60s!
Cook###No respect! No respect, this one!
Mae###YOU CAN KEEP YOUR HOLE PRETZELS
Mae###AND YOUR DAMP PIEROGIES
Mae###_o_ :|
Cook###YEAH YEAH YEAH
Cook###GO JUMP IN THE RIVER.
Mae###Usually someone fishing here. For tunnel fish. Because why the hell not.
Mae###The tunnel flooded, and we lost a bit more land to the fish.
Mae###I still can't believe they kept this place open after the flood took out the trolleys.
Mae###Never underestimate the power of old people to get state funding.
Mae###Which is why we have more war memorials than there were wars.
Mae###We were at Aunt Janet's place up in Fort Lucenne when that flood hit.
Mae###Our house had two feet of water in the living room when we came back.
Mae###Mudslides took out a few houses in Underhill.
Mae###Casey Hartley came by in his dad's boat.
Mae###Gregg kept trying to ride his bike in the water and got stranded on top of a doghouse.

Mae###Well if I can't get a pretzel this is basically a wet, underground old folks home.
Mae###Can't even get into rest of the tunnel right now, but it's just as well.
Mae###It's full of teens.
Mae###Ugh. Teens.
Mae###Always pretty empty in here this time of day.
Mae###Don't know why they don't just close up until dinner time.
Mae###=_=
Mae###But whatever, screw this place. They won't sell me a pretzel anyway.
Mae###o_o
Mae###It was years ago.
Mae###It was one pretzel.
Mae###I'm not a thief.
Mae###But I was [shake=.01][size=1.2]HUNGRY
Mae###What, did they want me to [size=1.2]STARVE[/all]?
Mae###=_=
Mae###They probably did.
Mae###Monsters.
Mae###o_o
Mae###I've stolen from better places than this!
Fisherman###Pale white tunnel fish.
Fisherman###Easy to catch and so delish.
Mae###That’s good.
Fisherman###Oh god you were listening
Rosa###mmm. You’re Mae.
Mae###yeah.
Mae###do I know you?
Rosa###you did when you were a baby child.
Rosa###Miss Rosa.
Mae###oh. Hm.
Mae###i’m sorry.
Rosa###it’s alright.
Rosa###time does that.
Rosa###you know, I knew your grandfather.
Mae###oh really?
Rosa###yes. Long ago.
Rosa###if you’d like to ever talk about him
Rosa###i got history to pass on
Rosa###before i join him
Rosa###heh heh
Mae###oh.
Mae###yeah, sure!
Rosa###i’m here from time to time
Rosa###stop by when you like
Rosa###and we’ll have ourselves a talk.
Rosa###history don’t keep itself
Mae###sounds like a plan, Miss Rosa
Rosa###until later, Mae Borowski.
Rosa###Oh, hello Mae!
Mae###Um.
Mae###Do I know you?
Rosa###I don't know if you remember me? Miss Rosa?
Mae###Hm...
Rosa###I knew your grandfather.
Rosa###I visited you the day after you were born.
Rosa###You were so small.
Mae###...
Rosa###I guess some things don’t change, eh?
Mae###How did you know grandad?
Rosa###I’m here most days, why don’t you stop by sometime
Rosa###and I’ll tell you all about him?
Rosa###things you might not know.
Mae###Alright, you’ve got my interest.
Rosa###Sweet curious child.
Rosa###Oh, hello?
Mae###hey. It’s mae.
Rosa###i remember. Ol’ clock upstairs ain’t stopped yet.
Mae###what did you want to tell me about granddad?
Rosa###well i’ll only say if you really want to know...
None###ha ha yes, i do want to know
None###is it scandalous?
Rosa###oh i don’t think so.
Rosa###i’m old enough that nothing feels scandalous anyway.
Mae###is that a thing that happens when you get old?
Rosa###heh heh... depends on the life you led
Mae###ok, anyway-
Rosa###you got a history of troublemakers in your family.
Rosa###on your daddy’s side in particular.
Mae###oh?
Rosa###go back far enough you got folks
Rosa###that were around for the real hard times
Rosa###when the workers went up against armies.
Mae###oh yeah I kinda remember something about that.
Mae###great-great-great-great grandpa or whatever.
Mae###might have gotten the number of greats wrong there
Rosa###your grandfather and i weren’t around for a lot of the violence
Rosa###that was before even our time.
Rosa###naw, we were around to watch the tide roll out.
Mae###...and?
Rosa###we’ll need to talk again another time.
Rosa###i get tired.
Mae###oh. Ok.
Mae###can i get you anything?
Mae###i don’t have any money.
Rosa###naw, i’m just fine Mae.
Rosa###we’ll talk another time.
Mae###ok! See you!
Mae###Hey Miss Rosa!
Rosa###oh, hello mae.
Mae###how are you feeling today?
Rosa###oh, i feel the damp and the cold down here
Rosa###but it’s in my bones wherever i go
Rosa###so no harm.
Mae###did you want to talk about granddad?
Rosa###oh yes, where was i?
None###something about a tide rolling out?
Rosa###what?
Rosa###oh right.
Rosa###that was a metaphor.
Mae###i figured.
None###troublemakers in my family?
Rosa###right
Rosa###back then there were places that brought us all together
Rosa###or at least brought us together in bits and bobs.
Rosa###the Ol’ smokeys
Rosa###the grand bears
Rosa###the lodge of old
Rosa###the church and the union.
Rosa###there’d be dances
Rosa###up at the H-Bee
Rosa###that’s where I met your granddad, oh… a lifetime ago.
Mae###what was he like back then?
Rosa###Plain in most respects.
Rosa###Prone to fits of melancholy
Rosa###but funny, and wild when the occasion called.
Rosa###surprising, is I guess the word.
Mae###hm.
Rosa###what’d your daddy say about him?
None###strict but nice?
Rosa###heh heh
Rosa###strict is funny.
Mae###why?
None###distant but... trying?
Rosa###sounds right
Rosa###that sounds...
Mae###you alright, Miss Rosa?
Rosa###oh yes.
Rosa###let’s talk another time.
Mae###ok.
Mae###hope you feel better?
Rosa###oh mae
Rosa###oh dear mae...
Mae###oh hey Miss Rosa!
Rosa###oh. Hello mae.
Mae###feeling better?
Rosa###as well as to be expected i s’pose.
Mae###that’s good.
Mae###did you want to talk about-
Rosa###your grandfather.
Mae###yeah
Rosa###Possum Springs was built on our backs and the backs before us.
Rosa###Time was they didn’t pay the people in real money
Rosa###paid in little tokens and bills stamped with the company name
Rosa###good at the company store
Rosa###for company goods.
Mae###back in school they showed us some of those.
Mae###weird quarters and stuff.
Rosa###your grandfather remembered. His daddy experienced it first hand.
Rosa###mine boss came into town, driving a big fancy car
Rosa###night i met your grandfather.
Rosa###a real bastard, that boss, god forgive him.
Rosa###your grandfather runs out of the dance,
Rosa###i think he was a bit drunk. Or just stupid in some brave way.
Rosa###he shouts “the guts of all bosses!”
Rosa###he all of a sudden has a hunting knife from somewhere
Rosa###and he slashes the boss’s tires.
Mae###:)
Mae###ha ha ha ha wow!
Rosa###picks up a rock, put it through the windshield
Rosa###then he climbs up
Rosa###i’m sorry, this part is a bit rude…
Mae###holy shit don’t stop
Rosa###he pees through the windshield hole.
Mae###this is amazing!
Mae###:|
Mae###did they catch him?
Rosa###naw, just me and a few other folks saw it.
Rosa###i trot over to him, and we run off down the alley
Rosa###past the A-OK drug store
Rosa###big field, big parking lot nowadays
Rosa###stars fat and bright
Rosa###i guess we were both pretty drunk
Rosa###one thing led to another,
Mae###oh. ok.
Mae###wait... when was this...?
Rosa###a... very long time ago.
Mae###was he...
Rosa###...
Mae###...
Rosa###...
Mae###so what happened with the car?
Rosa###got towed away.
Rosa###police couldn’t get no witnesses.
Rosa###we weren’t snitches about that kinda thing.
Mae###damn right.
Rosa###so like i said
Rosa###you got troublemaker blood.
Rosa###heh heh heh
Mae###geez. I never knew this.
Rosa###i don’t think your daddy even knows
Mae###i bet not.
Rosa###you gonna tell him?
None###yes
Mae###sometime
Mae###maybe
None###no
Rosa###secret keeper like me, eh?
Mae###i just think it’d be a weird conversation
Rosa###you may find someday it isn’t so strange.
Rosa###i wanted to pass this story along to you
Rosa###it was one night, one thing he did
Rosa###in a lifetime of nights and things he did
Rosa###what you want to do with that, is part of your story now.
Rosa###i can’t talk much more for today
Mae###i’d like to know more about him!
Mae###this was crazy.
Rosa###...
Rosa###i’ll see you, mae
Rosa###sooner or later.
Mae###ok.
Mae###bye, Miss Rosa!
Rosa###bye for now, Mae Borowski.
Fisherman###Wife long gone, kids don’t care.
Fisherman###Tunnel fish are always there.
Mae###Ha ha yeah man.
Fisherman###Oh god please don’t listen.
Mae###o/
Mae###Hey Ms. Quelcy! Are you on... a phone?
Mae###_o_
MissQuelcy###Mae, I think I found signal.
Mae###Oh my god.
MissQuelcy###I know, Mae. I know.
Not Stated###So how's art class this year?
Not Stated###I'm surprised you even carry a phone around town. No one else does.
MissQuelcy###Mae, you're scaring the signal away.
MissQuelcy###I have a comprehensive internal database of unsecured wifi hotspots.
Mae###That's scandalous.
MissQuelcy###Me stealing wifi is about the 10th most scandalous thing involving a phone I've encountered this week.
Mae###Oh?
MissQuelcy###I caught several students earlier this week, back of the art room, looking at ...visual reference.
Mae###Oh... :\
MissQuelcy###I swear they should stop calling these smartphones and start calling them tupperware for porn.
Mae###Yeah. They should call them that. :|
MissQuelcy###It's not like we get any signal in Possum Springs.
MissQuelcy###If I see a kid with a phone I just assume they're carrying a smut bomb waiting to go off.
MissQuelcy###Well, we're studying anatomy for figure drawing
MissQuelcy###and I'm trying to somehow work it into the sex ed class this district won't allow us to have.
Mae###I won't tell. :)
MissQuelcy###I guess if all else fails we could make onesies.
Mae###:|
Mae###Well, best of luck with the signal!
MissQuelcy###Hey, Mae? I know you just recently got back, but I have some free advice for you.
Mae###What's that?
MissQuelcy###Get out now while you still can.
Mae###Um. Thanks. :\
Mae###Why are you still here if you hate it so much?
MissQuelcy###Child, I am paid to be here.
Mae###Ok. Thanks?
MissQuelcy###Run. Run away. Get a job in far away lands. Join the circus. Be not here.
Mae###... :|
MissQuelcy###You're welcome.
Mae###Where is everybody?
TunnelTeen3###*mmf**mmf*
Mae###What?
TunnelTeen3###*MMF**MMF*
Mae###Oh my god. We used to do that. Awesome.
TunnelTeen3###*mmf**mmf**mmf*
Mae###Well you go easy on my street.
TunnelTeen3###*mmf**mmfmmffmffff*
Mae###Deal
Mae###Wow.
Mae###You guys sure did a number on my street.
TunnelTeen3###We did nothing.
TunnelTeen2###You got no proof.
Mae###That's my neighbor's pumpkin right there.
TunnelTeen2###This is a different pumpkin.
Mae###...
TunnelTeen1###Hey don't you know Lori?
Mae###Yeah.
TunnelTeen1###Oh ok.
TunnelTeen2###I thought so
Mae###Hey... uh... kind of a weird question, but
Mae###is anyone missing?
TunnelTeen3###What?
Mae###Like anyone you know who was out last night
Mae###and didn't come back?
TunnelTeen2###Uh.
TunnelTeen4###I don't think so?
TunnelTeen1###What's going on?
Mae###Nothing. Thought I saw something.
TunnelTeen3###Ok... uh...
TunnelTeen1###You should tell us if this is something.
Mae###Just be careful, ok? Keep an eye out
Mae###and let me know if you see anything weird, ok?
Mae###I mean you all hang out together constantly.
Mae###You're safer than anyone else I know!
TunnelTeen1###...
TunnelTeen1###Eff off.
TunnelTeen1###Hey don't you know Lori?
Mae###Yeah.
TunnelTeen1###Oh ok.
TunnelTeen2###I thought so
Mae###Hey teens.
TunnelTeen3###Hey.
Mae###So like... are you *always* together?
TunnelTeen1###Yeah I guess.
Mae###That's cool. Friends are cool.
Mae###Safer.
TunnelTeen3###Safer?
Mae###Yeah, like the buddy system.
Mae###Safety in numbers!!!
TunnelTeen4###You're a little paranoid, you know that?
Mae###Kid, you don't even know.
Mae###Anyone hear anything about anyone around here missing?
TunnelTeen3###Uh, yeah actually.
TunnelTeen3###There's some girl I know online
TunnelTeen3###she hasn't been on since Harfest.
Mae###Ok well I think we might need a bit more than that.
TunnelTeen3###Ok.
Mae###Is she from here? I could ask my aunt...
TunnelTeen3###some place called Mulvay
Mae###!!!! (eyes dilate, big frown)
Mae###*Mulvay*?
Mae###You know someone from *Mulvay*?
TunnelTeen3###Yeah?
Mae###Do you know where Mulvay is?
Mae###Do you know *WHAT* Mulvay is?
TunnelTeen3###No...
TunnelTeen1###I heard about Mulvay.
TunnelTeen1###My dad drives a bread truck.
TunnelTeen1###Mulvay used to be one of his stops.
Mae###What happened?
TunnelTeen1###He don't stop there no more.
TunnelTeen1###They had to pay some other guy to do it.
Mae###Sounds about right.
TunnelTeen3###WHAT'S Mulvay?
TunnelTeen1###I'll take you out there this weekend.
Mae###Don't.
TunnelTeen1###It'll be fine. We'll just drive through.
Mae###...
Mae###I need to go get back in the sun now.
Mae###So like... and I don't want this to sound weird, but...
Mae###Do you know of anyone who's gone missing in the past couple days?
TunnelTeen1###No?
TunnelTeen4###Nah, not that I know of
Mae###Ok, well tell me if you notice anyone is.
TunnelTeen3###You are really spooking me.
Mae###You and me both, kid.
TunnelTeen1###Eff off.
TunnelTeen1###Hey don't you know Lori?
Mae###Yeah.
TunnelTeen1###Oh ok.
TunnelTeen2###I thought so
Mae###Hey teens.
TunnelTeen3###Hey.
Mae###Hey you guys.
TunnelTeen2###Yeah?
Mae###Stay safe, alright?
TunnelTeen3###wow. Thanks mom.
TunnelTeen4###are you our new mom?
Mae###apparently.
Mae###life, man. it goes.
TunnelTeen1###slowly
Mae###nah, dude.
Mae###nah.
Mae###My babies are all fed. Momma don't need to steal today.
Mae###Delicious pretzels...
Mae###I bet some rat babies would love a delicious pretzel...
Mae###ugh probably not gonna get another chance today. dammit.
Mae###One pretzel is enough for my tiny rat darlings.
Mae###
Mae###HOLY SHIT.
Mae###The Dudes! Someone hecked up the dudes!
Mae###Who... did... this?
Mae###Why did they do it?
Fisherman###Many miners old and young
Fisherman###With home in heart and coal in lung
Fisherman###Were taken by the trolley men
Fisherman###Up to the mine and back again
Fisherman###But mudslide, flood, and awful storm
Fisherman###Have given tunnel fishes ho... rm.
Mae###"Horm?" :)
Fisherman###Please stop listening.
Mae###:|
Mae###Amazing to think these things used to run.
Mae###Kind of amazing they're still down here too.
Mae###No way to get them out of here I guess.
Mae###This place sure was something a long time ago.
Mae###I can't believe they've kept this open.
Mae###Historical note, I guess.
Mae###I think it's just because the old people like the pierogi stand.
Mae###Never underestimate the ability of old people to get state funding.
Council1###Damn shame
Council1###This was of historical note!
Council1###Without it I don’t know if we can justify keeping this place open...
Council1###
Council1###Because this mural is of historical note, Molly!
Council1###What do we know?
Molly###Well, sometime overnight
Molly###someone used bolt cutters on the gate
Molly###and came down here.
Council1###What’d they use, a paint roller?
Molly###Looks to be.
Council1###Says they intend to Nuke Poss... something?
Molly###I think it’s likely some kid
Molly###saw one of the old Nuke Possum Springs vandalisms from back when
Molly###and got bored halfway through writing it.
Council1###We need to treat this as a terrorist action.
Molly###I’m... sorry?
Council1###This mural is of historical note!
Molly###Alright well I’ll round up any… uh… terrorists I see.
Council1###Round up any dirtbag teens or vagrants that’ve been hanging around town
Council1###check out by the abandoned Food Donkey.
Council1###they come off the train there
Molly###Already on it.
Council1###Molly.
Molly###Yeah?
Council1###Find whoever did this.
Molly###Ok.
Council1###I want to see them hang.
Molly###I think at most they’d get a fine and some jail time
Molly###but alright. I’ll let you know when we’ve got something.
TunnelTeen1###Eff off.
Mae###No. Today *YOU* eff off.
TunnelTeen1###Dang, bud.
TunnelTeen1###Hey don't you know Lori?
Mae###Yeah.
TunnelTeen1###Oh ok.
TunnelTeen2###I thought so
Mae###Hey teens.
TunnelTeen3###Hey.
Mae###oof.
TunnelTeen1###Oof?
TunnelTeen2###you alright?
Mae###I guess.
TunnelTeen3###How old did you say you were?
Mae###20
TunnelTeen4###Told you she couldn't get us beer.
Mae###What do you want beer for anyway?
Mae###Beer is gross.
Mae###It's not delicious at all.
TunnelTeen1###Life ain't always delicious, mom.
TunnelTeen2###Thought you'd know that by now.
Mae###That doesn't even have any bearing on this.
Mae###I hear there is actual good-tasting alcohol out there.
Mae###I dunno. Fruit punch that makes you do things you regret.
TunnelTeen3###Right.
Mae###Am I uncool again?
TunnelTeen4###You never were cool, mom.
Mae###Dang.
TunnelTeen1###But life ain't always cool.
TunnelTeen2###Life is garbage.
TunnelTeen3###But like, you know. Whatever.
TunnelTeen4###Yeah. We're all trash anyway.
TunnelTeen1###We belong here.
Mae###Ok we can stop with the words of teenly wisdom now.
Mae###Catch you later.
Fisherman###Wife long gone, kids don’t care.
Fisherman###Tunnel fish are always there.
Mae###Ha ha yeah man.
Fisherman###Oh god please don’t listen.
Fisherman###Methinks I spy a tunnel shark
Fisherman###Scary monster in the dark
Mae###Holy crap!
Fisherman###I didn't really see it.
Fisherman###please don't listen.
Fisherman###Will tunnel fish be always there?
Fisherman###Will tunnel drain, canal be bare?
Fisherman###I would miss the tunnel fish.
Fisherman###To have them back would be my wish.
Mae###are they gonna drain the tunnel or something?
Fisherman###No. It's poetry, ok?
Fisherman###I'm just making stuff up!
Fisherman###Please don't listen!!!
Fisherman###When winter come and water freeze
Fisherman###Here the fish can be at ease
Fisherman###the tunnel is not flooded ruin
Fisherman###it's a home, a place for doin'
Mae###Sure. That works.
Fisherman###please go away.
Mae###Cool that people still hang around down here.
Mae###We used to do that when I was in highschool.
TunnelTeen1###yeah.
Mae###I wasn’t in high school that long ago, you know.
TunnelTeen2###How old are you?

Mae###i keep my options open!
Salvi###oh dear.
Mae###this... thing!
Mae###this garbage thing!
Salvi###oh, that’s a-
Mae###It’s like a... really bad boat paddle?
Mae###a very useless shield? For fighting?
Salvi###it’s a snowshoe.
Mae###oh.
Mae###never seen one before i guess.
Salvi###ideally you should have two of them.
Mae###eh. I can like... hop.
Salvi###snowhopper.
Mae###yes. It’s a snowhopper.
Salvi###...and somehow he’d run over his own foot
Mae###NO!
Salvi###...with the mower.

Salvi###but he still comes to work.
Mae###geeeez.
Salvi###gotta work!
Mae###oof.
Salvi###ok so remember how I said I needed a second pair of hands?
Mae###oh yeah! What was that about?
Salvi###so there’s a little panel back where you are
Salvi###gonna need you to use it and move this light up here
Mae###are we... wait... why?
Salvi###we got bats down here
Mae###so?
Salvi###i don’t like bats.
Salvi###but bats like bugs
Salvi###and bugs like light
Salvi###so you’re gonna shine that light all around ‘em and get ‘em to scatter
Salvi###lookin’ for bugs.
Salvi###they mostly go away for a while when they scatter.
Mae###oh... ok.
Salvi###now get ready, we’re comin’ up on a place they like to cluster together
Mae###ok I got it!
Salvi###here we go! Up above me!
Mae###wow!

Mae###I’m gonna put these in and find out.
Mae###...should probably clean them first...

Salvi###Find anything good?
Mae###nah.
Mae###Coconut Monkey!
Salvi###oh wow.

Salvi###uh. No.
Mae###not even tempted?
Salvi###i think I can let this one go, mae.
Mae###DRACULA TEETH!
Salvi###oh wow!
Salvi###i remember these!
Mae###they still make them.
Salvi###now there’s a market that never goes away.
Mae###people will always want to be draculas
Salvi###i don’t want to be a vampire.

Salvi###oh god please don’t they’re disgusting

Salvi###if they did they never said nothin’.
Mae###did the cops ever catch the guy?
Salvi###oh no. he’s still out there.

Salvi###with their beady eyes
Salvi###and fangs
Salvi###and w...w...wings!!!
Mae###why do you hate bats so much?
Salvi###they’re horrible, that’s why!
Salvi###Comin' up on another island.
Mae###how many of these are down here?
Salvi###oh, I ain’t counted.
Salvi###seem to find new ones all the time.
Salvi###and lose old ones.
Mae###spooky.
Salvi###we’re pretty far back now. It’s always a bit spooky.
Mae###whoa. Old trolley car over there.
Salvi###yeah we’re getting close to where the flood really hit hardest.
Mae###I can’t imagine this place still up and running.
Salvi###it was quite something.
Salvi###had a sense of... going somewhere.
Mae###yeah.
Salvi###way back when they got these “new” trolley cars
Salvi###they were designed by some company overseas
Salvi###big and fancy, like france or somethin’.
Mae###they are pretty.
Salvi###yeah they still got their charms.
Salvi###you gonna look around?
Mae###sure.
Mae###oh huh.
Mae###wonder how old this is?
Mae###it’s pretty soggy
Mae###what sport even is this?
Mae###it’s a sports mystery.
Mae###the worst kind of mystery.
Mae###it’s pretty though.
Mae###do I want this thing?
Mae###more than the very functional helmet?
None###yeah
Mae###could hang it on the wall.
Mae###that’d be pretty neat.
Mae###and then look up what it’s even for.
Mae###cool cool cool.
None###nah
Mae###it’s gross and i don’t care about sports.
Mae###anymore.
Mae###oh nice!
Mae###Football, our official religion around here.
Mae###I could totally wear this.
Mae###It’s functional!
Mae###I could totally wear this in the winter, in case I slip on the ice.
Mae###I could wear this if I was in a fight.
Mae###could probably stop a bullet even. I dunno.
Mae###It smells inside though...
Mae###do I want this thing?
Mae###more than that ancient flag thing?
None###yeah
Mae###it’s functional!
None###nah
Mae###it’s functional, but
Mae###the flaggy thing is mysterious.
Mae###Gotta go with the mystery.
Mae###hmmm.
Salvi###Find anything good?
Mae###nah.
Mae###Check this out!
Salvi###oh wow that’s an old hockey pennant.
Mae###how old?
Mae###like really old?
Salvi###uh. 1970s? 80s?
Mae###oh. That’s like
Mae###medium old.
Mae###we had a hockey team back then?
Salvi###sure did!
Salvi###ice arena used to be out by where ham panther is now.
Mae###geez. So much stuff used to be here.
Salvi###lots still here.
Salvi###but yeah. Lots gone.
Mae###Football helmet!
Salvi###oh... you sure you want that?
Mae###did i finally find something you want?
Salvi###well... i mean... it’s cool. You take it.
Mae###no, it’s alright.
Mae###it’s your boat. It’s your garbage.
Mae###you can have it.
Salvi###no, that’s fine Mae.
Mae###no, i think you should have it.
Salvi###no Mae. you take it.
Mae###TAKE IT.
Salvi###I DON’T WANT IT
Mae###NEITHER DO I - TAKE IT
Salvi###IT’S YOURS
Mae###GODDAMMIT YOU TAKE THIS EFFING HELMET

Mae###AAAAAAARGH YOU GO STRAIGHT TO HELL!!!!!
Salvi###are you ok?
Mae###yeah. Sorry I yelled.
Salvi###me too.
Salvi###you happy with your helmet?
Mae###yeah! It’s functional!
Mae###any more bats to get rid of?
Salvi###nah. They don’t come back this far to sleep.
Salvi###they fly around a good bit back here though
Salvi###unless you clear em off before you get here.
Mae###where even are we?
Salvi###almost to the far platform.
Mae###oh wow. Is that where we’re going?
Salvi###well
Salvi###you got rid of most of the bats back there...
Salvi###so maybe we can make one last stop
Salvi###at the big one.
Mae###"the big one?"
Salvi###yeah... don’t think we got rid of enough bats back there
Salvi###for them to not be a problem back here
Mae###oh. Sorry.
Salvi###ain’t no worry.
Salvi###we’ll head on out to the far platform.
Salvi###I thank god I wasn’t down here when the flood hit.
Mae###the river jumped, right?
Salvi###yeah. Flood was bad enough, river just up and moved.
Salvi###had something to do with the reservoir too, i forget.
Mae###I guess it was a while ago.
Mae###weird to think that rivers can move.
Salvi###oh they’re always moving, kid.
Mae###(20 year old)
Salvi###they’re just usually moving in one direction.
Salvi###no one’s really prepared for when it stops doing
Salvi###what it’s always been doing.
Mae###hm.
Salvi###alright, here we are.
Salvi###the big one.
Mae###wow.
Mae###this looks like something I dreamed
Mae###or something.
Mae###it’s familiar someways.
Salvi###Back then they thought the trolleys would stay on the track
Salvi###come a big flood.
Salvi###but nah. They went right along with the water.
Salvi###bobbing up and down
Salvi###crashing into big piles like this.
Mae###geez.
Salvi###can’t fix something like this
Salvi###what’re you gonna do?
Salvi###dam up the river? Dig this whole thing out?
Salvi###nobody got that money.
Salvi###nobody got that time.
Mae###this is like
Mae###visiting some place beyond the grave
Mae###like where you go when you die
Salvi###some folks *did* die down here
Mae###oh yeah.
Salvi###you gonna go look around?
Salvi###hafta say, not much back this far usually.
Salvi###most stuff washes in from side channels
Salvi###gets caught up back where we came from.
Mae###yeah. I think i’ll still look around.
Mae###wow.
Mae###wonder if it still works?
Mae###should probably clean all of the mud out of it first.
Mae###do i want to take this?
Mae###even more than the lock?
None###yeah
Mae###it’s really pretty.
Mae###it should have someone to appreciate it.
None###nah
Mae###i got nowhere to put it.
Mae###and i can’t play it.
Mae###also feel like some horn-playing ghost is gonna haunt me
Mae###if i take it from here.
Mae###wonder what this used to lock up?
Mae###really old lock.
Mae###pretty neat key.
Mae###someone bought this to keep something safe
Mae###or secret
Mae###do i want to take this?
Mae###more than the muddy horn?
None###yeah
Mae###this thing has like
Mae###someone’s intentions in it
Mae###or something.
Mae###it feels heavy.
Mae###someone should have it.
None###nah
Mae###it’s just junk now.
Mae###and i got nothing to lock up anyways.
Salvi###Find anything good?
Mae###nah.
Mae###horn.
Salvi###looks like a packhorn, maybe?
Mae###i’m gonna clean it out
Mae###maybe play it.
Mae###or at least make it make some noise.
Salvi###good plan.
Mae###it’s real pretty
Mae###shame to leave it down here.
Salvi###you rescued it.
Mae###i’m a hero.
Salvi###i’ll call the papers.
Mae###got a lock and a key
Salvi###oh. What are you gonna do with that?
Mae###i dunno. I just figured someone should have it.
Salvi###hm.
Salvi###that’s thoughtful, Mae.
Mae###i feel like we’re a thousand miles away from Possum Springs.
Salvi###yeah. We’re not so far though.
Salvi###let’s get going.
Salvi###here we are
Mae###wow.
Mae###ha ha ha
Salvi###what?
Mae###there’s some beer cans and a mattress back here
Mae###and a spot where a fire was
Mae###and a sock
Mae###and some weed, it looks like
Mae###someone did some partying back here
Salvi###ha ha ha ha. That must be new!
Mae###Teens. It was the teens.
Salvi###ha ha ha.
Salvi###There is nowhere you can go that the teens have not been already.
Mae###oh god... the mattress...
Salvi###that’s unsavory
Mae###who’s idea was it to get high, drunk, and then boink
Mae###way back here?
Salvi###it does seem a lot of trouble to go to.
Mae###this is hilarious.
Salvi###it’s very funny.
Salvi###so that’s it. That’s the other mural.
Mae###...
Mae###it’s so...
Mae###...
Salvi###yeah.
Mae###yeah.
Salvi###basically the only thing back here that survived the flood.
Mae###...
Salvi###i just think it’s nice that it’s not gone.
Mae###yeah i guess.
Mae###forgotten maybe, but not gone.
Salvi###well... not forgotten yet.
Mae###i wonder if in like 500 years
Mae###some archeologists will find it
Mae###and wonder what it meant.
Salvi###sometimes I think in 50 years no one will know what it meant.
Mae###places can’t control how they’re remembered
Mae###they just... hang out...
Mae###and then fall apart.
Salvi###you ok, mae?
Mae###yeah.
Mae###i’ll be fine.
Mae###i’m just gonna look for a minute.
Salvi###take your time.
Mae###...
Mae###Hello? Are you dead?
Mae###Did you get run over?
Rick###Nah kid I’m just fixin' 'er up.
Mae###Isn't it dangerous to be under a car on a hill?
Rick###I do not fear death, kid.
Mae###Adult.
Rick###Death fears me.
Mae###yeah ok but
Rick###I'll drive this car right over the grim reaper.
Mae###ok.
Mae###Do you live here or something?
Rick###Yeah kid, Rekkage Manor is right behind you.
Mae###Adult.
Mae###Wait a sec- are you Rick Rekkage?
Mae###Like, The Creeping Deadlies Rick Rekkage?
Rick###Yeah kid. I’m him. He’s me.
Mae###How’s the band?
Rick###Great. Playin' out. Free beer.
Rick###Stop by the bar some night and see us!
Mae###I’m not 21 yet.
Rick###Aw don't worry kid. You'll be a real person soon.
Mae###Adu-
Mae###whatever.
Rick###
Mae###Hello child.
StoopKid###What do you want?
Not Stated###Your blooooood.
Not Stated###What are you doing?
StoopKid###Watching squirrels. Squirrels are weird.
Mae###They're really just fancy rats.
StoopKid###How much of it?
Mae###All of it. Every last drop of sweet, sweet child bloooood.
StoopKid###Are you a monster lady?
Mae###The most monster of all ladies.
StoopKid###My mom says I'm not supposed to talk to you.
Mae###Why?
StoopKid###Because one time you hurt somebody and no one knows when you might do it again.
Mae###That was a long time ago.
StoopKid###She says you had a lot going for you but you threw it in the garbage.
Mae###Your mom sounds great.
StoopKid###She says you didn't even try when you went to college
StoopKid###and now you've blown your only chance to avoid living in an abandoned train car.
Mae###Wow, kid. Is your mom going to publish a newsletter?
StoopKid###I'm not going to talk to you if that's ok.
Mae###Tell your mom I said hey.
Varney###If he falls through one of my windows I will not hesitate to take legal action.

Mae###But we did get a library!
Mae###...that got turned into apartments!
Mae###Hm. Don't think I've ever read this plaque before.
Mae###Arnold A. Applebaum.
Mae###"A father to all workers,"
Mae###"a grandfather to their children,"
Mae###"a great-grandfather to those children's children..."
Mae###It keeps going like that for awhile.

Mae###Bea has this dude right outside her window.
Mae###Constantly.
Mae###Arnold Stalkerbaum.

LizChandler###and climb in my window.
Mae###oh geez. That’s spooky.
LizChandler###You never want someone hanging around outside your window.
Mae###not magical evil statues at least.
LizChandler###yeah nothing evil or magic should get that close.
Mae###I live in the attic. No one can get to my window.
LizChandler###That’s good.
Mae###not even vampires or warlocks or skeleton men.
Mae###I’m glad we had this talk.
LizChandler###Me too.
Mae###see ya!
Council1###...that doesn’t really answer the question, Colleen.

Bea###What do you mean?
Mae###I'm gonna distract the clerk. I can do this.
Bea###Ok I will admit that drawing attention is a talent you have.
Mae###I'm great at crimes.
Bea###But what if I get caught?
Mae###You won't. I'll just start screaming if I have to.
Bea###How is that a good idea?
Mae###Let's go.
Bea###Ok but if this goes wrong I'm blaming you.
Mae###Join the club.
Mae###hmmm...
Bea###Wow. Haven't seen belt buckles in awhile.

Bea###WHAT?! NO!!
Mae###SHHHH!!!

Mae###Do you ever want to tell them?
Angus###What, about the internet?
Angus###About rental by mail?
Mae###Yeah.
Angus###Mae, it's not my job to save them
Angus###I am paid to stand here, assist when needed,
Angus###take their money, and not openly judge them.
Angus###There's a certain romance to vhs and dvd
Angus###that simply cannot be matched.
Mae###...really?
Angus###Nope.
Mae###Wait, you actually have vhs?
Angus###Mostly the adult section back behind the curtain.
Mae###WHOA, really?
Angus###Yeah some folks are like really into seeking them out.
Angus###It's like a whole little scene that goes back before the internet.
Angus###We had a historian in there last month looking for some obscure video.

Angus###I think that's the kind of job you can only have
Angus###if you don’t need to have a job.
Mae###So this party tonight, huh?
Angus###Yeah. Should be fun?

VideostoreGirl###I just didn’t comment on it?
Mae###Really?
VideostoreGirl###Yeah?
Mae###Huh?
VideostoreGirl###Can I help you?

VideostoreGirl###
VideostoreGirl###
Angus###Hey Mae.
Mae###Hey Angus. How's it going?
Angus###You are like the third person I've seen today.

Angus###You'd be surprised.
Mae###Band practice later?
Angus###Gotta warm up my voice!
Mae###You growl real good.
Angus###Thanks. I'm a born growler.
Angus###When I was a baby I never cried
Angus###I just growled.
Mae###I think I cried nonstop until I was like 9
Mae###and then I cried all the time again starting at like 13...
Angus###You had a good three years of not crying in there!
Mae###They were really productive years.
Angus###Heh heh.
Angus###You up for band practice in a bit?
Mae###I guess. Weird night.
Angus###How so?
Mae###I'll tell you about it later.

Angus###Yep.
Mae###...ok
Angus###Sorry. Don't mind me.
Angus###My legs are still sore from running from that dude.
Mae###I'm just sore in general.
Mae###and tired.
Mae###in general.
Angus###My life doesn't involve a lot of running.
Mae###heh heh
Mae###I feel like I should have
Mae###some sort of clever comment to follow that up.
Angus###You can get back to me.
Angus###So, I said I could like
Angus###take you up to the park.
Mae###you did indeed.
Mae###I'm so tired.
Angus###you gonna be ok?
Mae###yeah, i'll be fine
Angus###You up for this park trip?
None###Naw
None###Yeah
Mae###Wow. Bea let you have the car two nights in a row?
Angus###yeah
Mae###Even after the flat tire?
Angus###Well, I mean, you can’t really do anything about that
Angus###and I replaced the tire.
Mae###Oh yeah.
Mae###Cool you could borrow her car, though.
Mae###I had to ride on Gregg’s bike
Mae###when we saw that ghost.
Angus###Yeah Gregg needs to get his license.
Mae###I fell off his bike.
Mae###which I *also* did a few days before that
Mae###I’M EXCITED! \o/

Angus###Yeah, I guess huh?
Mae###I’ve been hanging out with Gregg so much
Mae###it’ll be nice to actually get to know you a little better!
Angus###I’m pretty great.
Mae###Ghost hunting with Angus!
Angus###So you think the guy you saw was a ghost?
Mae###not a guy- a GHOST
Angus###right.
Mae###Why does no one believe me that it was a ghost?
Angus###Well, I mean… Ghosts don’t actually exist.
Mae###I’m pretty sure they do.
Angus###Well, I’d need evidence.
Mae###What counts?
Angus###A ghost walking up and saying hello
Angus###and me saying hey I’ve verified you are a dead person.
Mae###Could be a zombie or a frankenstein.
Angus###ok maybe if they’re made of ghosty stuff
Mae###Ghosty Stuff can be our podcast
